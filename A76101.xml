            <title>The arrovv of the Almighty shot out of the creatures bowe, against the uncalled ministers in England. Or, A messages sent to them to forewarn them of their determined destruction, before it fall upon them. Likewise here is shewed, from whence they had their calling into the ministery; and how all people have been decieved by them. Here is also a glass wherein all formalists may see their own deformity, and so seek after that which is the substance, wherein all their deformity shall be done away. Likewise here is opened the mystery of the Lords Supper, and the mystery in Baptism; and how there is a threefold Baptism, having relation to the three fold name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; with other truths very needful to be known. All of them being laid down in as brief a manner as possiblemay be, for the use and instruction of the Presbyterians, Independants, and Anabaptists, so called; or for the good of all others who have a minde to seek God in a right way; and in the conclusion, a word to the free-gracians.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riends, you who (pretend to be, or) call your ſelves the Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſent by God to declare his will and minde to the people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and who have theſe many hundred years reigned and ruled, by means of Authority, and Devilliſh, Popiſh, and Kingly power, by which your heads have been born up, and your hands made ſtrong, and your hearts made haughty; ſo that you are become great in your own eyes, yea, and wiſe in your own conceits, and who but you for wiſdom; but I ſhould have ſaid, who but you for wit; for wit and wiſdom differeth both in the ground, and in the operation, and in the effect; but no more of that, for my intention is not to argue caſes, or ſtand upon diſtinction of words; but to ſpeak the ſimple and ſubſtantial truth, and to lay open both to your ſelves, and all the world, what hath been kept hid from you, and by your means the knowledge thereof hath been kept from others, whereby moſt of the ſons of men is become blinded of that which is the cheif good: And to this day the myſtery of the knowledge of the cheif good hath been kept under by you; ſo that even thoſe ſouls, who cry you up, and bleſs God for having you to be their Teachers, ſhall one day as faſt cry you down, and ſhall curſe the time that they ſo much adhered to you; but this ſhall not be until the day of the revelation of truth, and in that day you ſhall be all of you accounted as an abomination amongſt men, in ſo much that ſhame ſhall cover all your faces; and that you ſhall be had in as great diſ-eſteem, as ever you have been had in honor, yea, and that man that
<pb facs="tcp:118484:3"/>lendeth a hand to pull you down, ſhall be accounted happy, yea, and ſhall receive a reward of God for his work. But this will not come upon you ſo ſoon, as ſome imagine, neither ſhall this day be deferred ſo long as others think, but this day ſhall overtake you; and as you have kept the truth in obſcurity, ſo ſhall you be kept in obſcurity by the truth: This day is in dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the full noon-tide ſhall be your obſcurity; and, as yet you have ſome ſeeming ſplendor among men, therefore your deceit is not as yet truly manifeſted, and as yet authority ſtands for you: But let me tell you in plain Engliſh, Authoritie ſhall not be able to defend you, though the Parliament ſhould do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but act for your upholding, yea, though all the Armies in the Land ſhould fight for you, and though you both preach and pray for your ſelves, and againſt all others, yet all ſhall be to little purpoſe; for the truth ſhall be your overthrow: For why, you have in your generation been the chief oppoſers of the truth, and ſo the truth ſhall be your ruine; and be as envious as you can, and be as cunning as you can, yet truth will finde you out, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you have hid your ſelves. I know you may beguile men by changing your coats from black to gray, and by turning from Popery to Prelacy, and from Prelacy to Presbyterie, &amp; from Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery to Independency, and from Independency to Rebaptizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know you may do this, yea, and will do this, if you can but perceive more ſafetie in one thing, then in another; but yet for all your ſubtil changing, you carry your old ſelfiſh hearts with you, and in your ſubtil dealing you ſhall not be ſecure; for though thereby you oft-times beguile the eyes of blinded-men, and make them conceive, that you are new converts, becauſe your Coat and your Form is changed, yet the eie of jealouſie ſeeth you, and will finde you out; and neither ſhall your chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Coats, nor your changed Forms, be able to ſhelter you from the hand of Juſtice; for turn you what way you will, ſo long as your pride and covetouſneſs is in your hearts, you are but the enemies of God, and his truth, though the fame be hid from your own beholding.</p>
            <p>And I much marvel that men ſhould be ſo far from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth, and yet ſo fair to pretend truth: But this is a myſterie bound up, in, and among Gods treaſures, and the moſt in your generation is bound up faſt under lock and key, from the knowledge of this myſterie: And this hath faln upon you in
<pb facs="tcp:118484:3"/>your generation; and when God ſhall begin to make his truth appear among men, he will not own you to be his inſtruments in that work, but ſhake you off; for you ſhall have neither lot nor portion in that matter; for you think, yea, and are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſay, That you are Gods Miniſters, and ſo think that you have God obliged to your Miniſtrie; and ſo have, and would have all other people tied under you by the bonds of captivitie; but you ſhall ſee it otherwiſe when God beginneth to beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for you ſhall then ſee, that he is not tied to Univerſities, nor any of thoſe Miniſters that have learned the art of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there: No, no, the truth ſhall daſh you and your art to peeces, and the people ſhall be delivered from your cruel bonds. But this ſhall not be in this old poiſoned generation, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to live on the empty husks you give them, &amp; who delight in nothing but that which pleaſeth their curious wit, and fooliſh fancy, which always delighteth to have things framed according to its own conceiting. And you have been the cauſe of the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many a poor ſoul, who have been bewitched by your ſmooth charms; and yet poor hearts they could not know, nor to this day can know how you do beguile them. O, that I, and all Gods people, who know the truth, had heads full of water, that our tears might run down day and night, for the ſlain of our own fleſh and blood; and yet poor hearts, their bodies liveth in the world, and their hearts liveth in the Creature, and their God liveth in their head, and they worſhip him according to your blinde precepts, and they love to have it ſo; and yet is their poor ſpirits under the chains of ſin, death, devil, and hell, and yet you nor they can be made beleeve that this is ſo: And this is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits of your wiſe preaching, by way of Uſe and Doctrine, which you have learned at the Holy Univerſitie, you ſo much boaſt of. But I tell you plainlie, that ſince your wiſe preaching had its beginning, the truth of God hath been hid by it, and ſo the ſouls of men have been deprived of the ſweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments thereof. O wo be to you for your work, yea, wo and ſorrow ſhall be your portion, in a far greater meaſure then any of the ſons of men; yea, you ſhall one day curſe the time that your fathers put you to the Holy Univerſitie to make you Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, nay, you ſhall wiſh that they had put you to learn the trade of Tinklers, when they put you to learn the trade of Preaching; though at preſent you glory in your trade, and
<pb facs="tcp:118484:4"/>think you are the Miniſter of the Goſpel. I know your pride is ſo great, that when you ſee theſe lines, you will be ready to burn them, and make a ſcoff of me for writing them; but that is no new thing, for I know your ſpirits well enough; neither do I care for your diſpleaſure, for I know in whom I have believed, and who cauſed me to write theſe lines, and him I deſire to obey.</p>
            <p>Its poſſible ſome of you may Petition to Authority to get me puniſhed for my plainneſs with you, as ſome of your Brethren have done in theſe daies, againſt ſome poor people, unto whom God hath more clearly manifeſted both his Juſtice and Mercy to their ſouls, without your Miniſtry, then ever he did to any ſoul under your Miniſtry. And this maketh you all ſtark mad, that God ſhould do any thing in any ſoul, but by you; and ſo you both in Preaching and Petitions, go about both to ſcandalize and perſecute the truth of God, and thoſe ſouls in whom the truth is. But this ſhall return upon you with ſhame, and your own preaching and acting againſt the truth ſhall be your over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
            <p>But friends, I would not have you in the leaſt to miſtake me in what I write in general to you; for no truth is ſo general, but there may be ſome particular exception admitted in it: ſo in this that I have written to you; for though I expreſs you all in general, yet my charitie cauſeth me to admit of ſome particular exception of ſome amongſt you, in ſome reſpect; for far be it from me to condemn the truth in any man, or in any order, if I can but perceive the leaſt appearance thereof in any ſoul. But that which I judge and condemn amongſt you all is, the illegal, and unjuſt calling, and coming into the Miniſtrie, and your pride and covetouſneſs in the Miniſtrie, and the ignorance of the truth of God in the Miniſtrie, and the great unknowing of God (in the people) as he ought to be known, the which hath been the evil fruits and effects of your Miniſtrie. I confeſs that many of you have wit and ſchollarſhip enough, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Argument with Papiſts, and any other Formaliſts that differ in judgement with you, and that many of you be able enough to take a ſentence of Scripture, and divide it into ſo many parts, as the ſence of ſpeech will carry; and ſo out of every part to raiſe out Doctrines and Uſes, Applications and Concluſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo may beget a form of truth in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:118484:4"/>of your hearers; and when this is done, yet the power of truth is hid from you in your wiſe ſpeaking, and from them in their wiſe hearing: For the power of the truth is one thing, and the form of truth is another thing; and the form of truth I know you hold out, and may hold out by your wit and ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larſhip taught you in your Univerſities. And this I know, one man may teach another, and as he is taught, ſo may he ſpeak, yea, and by the work of the brain, may adde much to what hath been taught; and yet for all this, the heart is far enough from the enjoyment or partaking of the power of truth: And where the power of truth is wanting in any of you, though you have the form of truth, yet are you none of thoſe whom God calleth into the Miniſtrie; but you ſhall one day be judged and condemned as theeves, who came not in at the door, but by ſome other way. Though you put this off your ſelves, and apply it to others, whom the Lord hath raiſed of his own accord, to ſpeak what they know of God; and have in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the truth, and can bear witneſs to the truth; and by theſe your falſhood becometh to be ſomewhat diſcovered: And therefore great is your malice and envy againſt them; but yet they ſhall increaſe, and you ſhall decreaſe, for the Lord will turn your skirts about your head, and your nakedneſs and ſhame ſhall be diſcovered to all men.</p>
            <p>I know that many amongſt you who are envious fools, and haters of the truth, do jear and ſcoff at experienced men, and ſpeak evil of them behinde their back, yet will fawn upon them to their face, becauſe they know theſe are too hard for them in matter of ſpeaking of the truth, <hi>as it is in Jeſus;</hi> and like beaten Cocks will hide their heads under the others wings, and will aſſent to what they ſay, becauſe they cannot gain-ſay it; but when their backs is turned, then they will ſcandalize and ſpeak evil of theſe perſons, and wreſt their words to that which was never intended: And when a pack of theſe fools is met together in their pots, then do they ſtrengthen the hands one of another, and make their malicious ſcandals compleat, and then goeth about to make the ſimple people beleeve, that ſuch and ſuch men is perillous and erroneous perſons, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth them to take heed of them, leaſt they be ſeduced by them. And thus do ſome of you ſeek to undermine the truth, and the reaſon is, becauſe the truth will be their undoing.</p>

            <p>But other amongſt you, I know, is more witty, and will not be ſo much againſt experienced men; but perceiving that God owneth them, they will not altogether ſpeak againſt theſe as do the other, but rather make uſe of their theeviſh art, and ſteal ſome experiences from the mouth of others, and can lay them up in their memories, and make as much uſe of them as their own, and ſpeak of them before others, inſomuch that ſome may judge them to have received ſomething of God; but yet this is but the proper work of wit, which hath power to meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphiſe man into any ſhape, which it conceiveth to be moſt in faſhion, and wherein moſt ſafety ſeems to be.</p>
            <p>But others amongſt you I know, that their pride and malice is ſo great, that they will beat down truth both with word and ſword, and their zeal is ſo great for the advancing of the glory of God, that they will both preach, pray, and fight againſt the truth; and by all means ſeek to devour and deſtroy all perſons in whom the truth appears: But it is no marvel, for truth always found many enemies amongſt men, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among Prieſts in all ages; and it will be ſo, as long as the order of Prieſts is in date.</p>
            <p>Yet I confeſs, though your coming into the Miniſtry be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely againſt the minde and command of God, as was the firſt order of Kings in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that God hath winked at you above thirteen hundred years, and ſuffered you to come into the Miniſtry by the ordinance of man; yet as God owned ſome of the Kings in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo I make no doubt, but that God hath owned ſome amongſt you; but yet I beleeve <hi>Solomons</hi> account may be their number, and thoſe amongſt you whom God hath owned, or to this day do own, they are made to ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the emptineſs of their wits and ſchollarſhip in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the minde, and will of God, and findeth their art learned in the Univerſities, to be one of the greateſt enemies againſt the truth of God, the which they have to deal withal; and they can ſpeak by experience, that Univerſitie learning is but a meer cheat, and a fooliſh thing to make a right Miniſter of the word of truth, and ſo is made to renounce all the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of art and ſchollarſhip: And as they have received the truth from the Fountain of truth, ſo are they made to ſpeak; and theſe ſouls cannot envy any man in whom the truth is, but rejoyceth to ſee them, and hear them ſpeak, and accounteth
<pb facs="tcp:118484:5"/>them as the Miniſters of God, though they were never put to the Holy Univerſitie; for the ſame ſpirit proceeding from the ſame Fountain maketh no difference, and theſe men accounteth it their joy to be in the ſocietie of people who be experienced; and they ſeek no Lordſhip over the people, nor are they ſo hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry hearted after Tithes, and great Benefice, but can rather condeſcend to work with their own hands for their Bread. But I beleeve you have not many of theſe amongſt you, for the curſe hath covered the faces of the moſt of you in your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, under which you are cloſe ſealed from the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth, and can no more beleeve your deceit, then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion. But ſeldom doth God exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute juſtice upon any people, before he give them warning of their ſin, and after that a time to repent.</p>
            <p>But who is it that dare bring ſuch a Meſſage from the Lord as ſhall declare the iniquitie of the Prieſts, and give them warning to repent, and forſake their ſin and falſhood, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel them of their deſtruction, if they repent not.</p>
            <p>Who, I ſay, dare be ſo bold as proclaim ſuch a thing, ſeeing the Authority of Nations ſtands for them, and accounteth them men worthy of honor, and ſit men for the promulgating of the Goſpel; and moſt of the people eſteem them little leſs then gods, yea, and themſelves account themſelves the onely men fit to be forewarners and inſtructers of all others. May not ſuch a one as bringeth ſuch a ſad Meſſage to them, expect to be envied, and evil ſpoken of, yea, and perſecuted to death? I know the man that ſhall be ſent with this Meſſage cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, no more ſhall I; for when firſt the Lord put this into my heart, the which my Pen hath put down in theſe lines, I was very unwilling to yeeld obedience thereunto, becauſe my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſet before mine eyes the great hazard I ſhould run, if I ſhould meddle in any ſuch thing; but the Lord would not ſuffer me to be quiet, until I undertook this Meſſage; and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had I abide your fury, and the diſpleaſure of all men, then to be diſobedient to the voice of the Lord: And as the Lord liveth in me, my malicious part hath not cauſed me to write theſe lines, though you may ſo judge of me; for I proteſt in the preſence of God, I unfainedly wiſh all your good, and ſhould very much rejoyce to know of your repentance, and ſhould no leſs be heartily ſorry for your deſtruction, if I ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:118484:6"/>live to ſee it: For that which I have received of God, teacheth me to love all men, and wiſh well to all men, and I am glad at the welfare of all men, and cannot but be ſorry at the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any, though he be my greateſt enemy, and would lend him my help, if I could do him any good, if he came into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, either of body or minde: Therefore my ſpirit being free, I hope to bear all that any of you ſhall either inflict upon my name or perſon; and though you ſhall hate me, yet I cannot chuſe but love you, as you are my fellow Creatures, and of the ſame fleſh and blood with me: And my advice to you is, that you ſlight not theſe lines, but ſearch your own hearts, and if the light of God go along with you, you ſhall finde that I have not wronged you at all; for what I here declare unto you ſhall be found true, either to convince you, or to be a witneſs againſt you.</p>
            <p>But my Friends, I would have you to know that I have not ſaid the tenth part of what I have committed to me, to ſpeak concerning you; for I have been as much ſparing as poſſible I could be, in what I had to declare to you; and if this my firſt Meſſage be ſlighted by you, and return upon my ſelf, it is very poſſible it will draw out a fivefold heavier meſſage with it, but I will not be too tedious at preſent. If I may pray for you, I wiſh that God would open your eyes, and make ſenſible your hearts, that you might be acquainted with the great Myſtery of ſin and ſelfneſs in you; and out of the true knowledge and right ſence thereof, that you may be made fit to diſcover the myſterie of ſin and ſelfneſs in all other. And that you may be rightly made partakers of the myſtery of the Divine Nature, that from the enjoyment thereof, you may be made able to know and comprehend with all Saints, what is the height and depth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to know the fellowſhip of the love of God which paſſeth knowledge, that ſo you may be able to hold out to others the myſterie therein contained; and then ſhall you be acquainted with the Will and Minde of God; and what you know that ſhall you ſpeak, and then you ſhould ſee, that all your Art and Schollarſhip is not worth a ſtraw, and that all your Uſes and Doctrines from thence proceeding, is but a meer fooliſh and fantaſtick invention, whereby the form of truth hath been upholden by you, and the power of truth kept down by that invention: From whence it is, That the hearts
<pb facs="tcp:118484:6"/>of the people hath been ſo glewed to ſin and ſelfneſs, and covereth themſelves from the knowledge thereof, by a fair ſeeming form taught them by your art, through the help of your good thinking.</p>
            <p>Friends fare you well, I have no more to ſay at preſent, and what you finde in theſe enſuing lines, make good uſe of them, for there is more in them then fools can know or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, but the wiſe ſhall reap the benefit thereof.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, if thou have any deſire to ſeek after the chiefe good, for the everlaſting well being of thy Spirit, for thy better underſtanding (and true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) I have drawn theſe enſuing lines; but I would not have thee to thinke that I expect any praiſe of thee, if there be any thing in them praiſe worthy, for I confeſſe theſe lines had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to thy view, (with any conſent of mine, as I am a weake and worthleſſe creature) had it not been that he who hath the commanding power over all Creatures, by the command he hath over me, did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter me, and as it were forced this inſuing Treatiſe to be written by me: for I confeſſe, I did as much reſiſt the Word of the Lord, in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me to write theſe lines, as ever did any of his Prophets, when hee ſent them to pronounce any Judgement upon any people for their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but while I gain-ſaid the Lord in what he would have me to ſpeake, I had but little reſt day or night, untill I ſet on worke, and put my Pen to paper to draw theſe inſuing lines; and as farre as I have declared to you the minde of theſe motions that wrought ſo ſtrongly in me, ſo farre I have found reſt, yet I know I have not here declared at large what I ought to have declared, and therefore as yet my ſpirit is not at that peace the which it deſires, yet I have prevailed that what I have here written may be acceptable untill further opportunity.</p>
            <p>But what is here preſented to thy view, I wiſh thee to weigh ſeriouſly, and though it may ſeem to croſſe thee in that which thou doſt beleeve to be truth, yet in queſtioning it I wiſh thee to queſtion thy ſelfe alſo, and if the ſame ſpirit be in thee which was in the Author when he wrote it, thou ſhalt be made to ſee that there is a truth in it, the which as yet hath been hid from thee, eſpecially if thou be one that hath had no other ſight of truth, but what thou receiveſt through the ſpectacles of the falſe Prieſts, and haſt knowne nothing of God but what thou haſt been taught by their precepts,
<pb facs="tcp:118484:8"/>and ſo hath blinded thee of the true knowledge both of God and of thy ſelfe, and have cloſed thee up within the Priſon walls of weake formes, wherein thy poore ſoule hath been kept priſoner, and fed with Pulſe and Huskes: and as for that which is the chiefe food of thy ſoule, thou haſt not as yet had a taſte thereof.</p>
            <p>But if thou have but any of the pure operations of the truth of God in thy ſoule, by which thy deſire is led out, in ſeeking that which is the chiefe good, I hope this will be of ſome uſe for thee, for herein thou ſhalt in ſome meaſure ſee how thou haſt been blindly led by the blinde Prieſts and their precepts, and thou ſhalt ſee how they had their calling into the Miniſtery, and from whence their originall beginning was, and how they have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to this day, and wherein they have been the cauſe how the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is kept from appearing amongſt the ſons of men; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe here thou ſhalt ſee diſcovered the emptineſſe of all formes, and the ground of formes, and how the moſt part of things contained in formes is but only traditionall, and therefore but ſuperſtitions, and how the pureſt things in formes are but Idolatry, when the minde of him that ordained them is unknown.</p>
            <p>And here is ſet out before thine eyes that which is the myſterie, and the minde of him who left the ſome in darke types, and gave command for the obſerving of the ſame, that ſo his minde might be found out in the myſterie of theſe types, whereby the ſoule might be drawne out of that which is the type, into that which is the myſterie of the type.</p>
            <p>And if thou be either in the forme of the Presbyterian order, or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Congregation, or of the Brother-hood of the Anabaptiſts, if thou be not ſetled on the lees in thy forme, I know thou wilt be made to ſee, that there is not that happineſſe in thy form, the which thou thoughtest there had been in it, and then I hope this will partly ſhew thee what the ſubſtance of truth is, and where it is to be found, and how it ought to bee ſought; and as thy deſire is upright in the ſeeking of that which is the life and ſubſtance of all things, thou wilt be made to accept this weake diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of truth, but if thou be one who is ſetled on the lees in thy forme. I know thou will but finde little herein to pleaſe thee, for I know it will bee in appearance to thee as a thief, who would take from thee thy treaſure thou liveſt of, and delighteſt in, and wilt rather ſnarle and fight with it (in thy wit) then to yeeld thy ſelfe to be robbed by it. But whatever thou art, or in what forme ſoever thou liveſt, I would have thee to underſtand my minde truly in what is here offered to thee; for I would have thee to know that I am not ſuch an enemy to formes as that I would have them abſolutely
<pb facs="tcp:118484:8"/>deſtroyed, or forſaken of any, except to change them for that which is the chiefe good; and when the chief good is truly attained, it doth not deſtroy formes no more then true faith deſtroyeth good workes; for I confeſſe and know, that formes in their time and places is as neceſſary as the Alphabet is in the beginning, to teach Children the Art of reading, the which is of neceſſary uſe in their time and place; but yet if the Master ſhould ſtill keep the Schollar learning his Alphabet, and bring him on no further, hee would be found an unperfect, and unprofitable Teacher; and ſo it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that thoſe Miniſters who teach, and binde up the people in formes, and bring them no further, are as unfit, and as unprofitable as is ſuch a Maſter. But as the Maſter bringeth a Schollar out of his Alphabet by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to be perfect in reading, yet can he not read without the letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Alphabet, but even in his reading the whole letter is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though they be not expreſſed one by one.</p>
            <p>So it is with thoſe who are rightly brought out &amp; beyond the form into that which is the ſubſtance, the ſubſtance doth no more deſtroy the forme then reading doth the Alphabet letters, though the ſame be acted and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from another ground, and in another manner; for this I know, that all thoſe who never ſought God in any wiſe, but have followed their owne Luſts to the full, even the forme ſhall judge them, and they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the not uſing thereof; and all who have taken any forme up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, if they live in that forme, and yet be deprived of the ſubſtance, by making an Idol of their forme, the ſubſtance it ſelfe ſhall judge and condemne them, and in their formes they ſhall periſh; and what I here have holden out (if rightly underſtood) doth not at all make voyd any forme, in caſe the forme be rightly grounded upon command, and example in Scripture, according to this preſent diſpenſation wherein we live, and that the minde of the Commander be underſtood in giving out command to obſerve any thing.</p>
            <p>But that which I ayme at, is to let thee ſee the emptineſſe of all formes without the power and ſubſtance of that which is the truth, and that no forme ſhould blinde thee in ſeeking that which is above formes; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, that if ever God owne thee, and draw thee rightly to himſelfe, thou ſhalt finde no leſſe evill in thy forme then thou haſt found in thy groſſe offences; and thou ſhalt ſee thou haſt been kept, be it at a great diſtance, from the true partaking of that which is the truth indeeds: but in what forme ſoever thou art, I would not have thee to leave off, or leap out of thy forme, before thou be truly called out of it, by that which is more excellent then thy forme. For this I tell thee, if thou leave thy form for any thing elſe,
<pb facs="tcp:118484:9"/>be ſure thou ſhalt be found a tranſgreſſor, and I know thou wilt fall to a very looſe converſation, and that will prove a great abomination.</p>
            <p>And while thou art in thy forme, and yet is not called out of it, by that which is more excellent, take it for granted, thou wilt ſettle downe upon the lees in thy forme, and then thy forme will be abomination.</p>
            <p>Therefore ponder the myſterie between theſe two, and take theſe few lines in good part, and if thou have but halfe an eye, they ſhall be as a glaſſe; wherein thou mayeſt partly perceive the middle way between two extreames; and if ever thou come to hit right into the myſterie or middle way, I know thou ſhalt not miſſe of the way that Chriſt himſelfe went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and then wilt thou take up thy Croſſe and follow after him, and then ſhalt thou know the fellowſhip of his ſuffering, and that ſhall bring thee to the fellowſhip of the communion of the Father, and the Sonne, of which thou ſhalt ſee more expreſſed in this inſuing Treatiſe, the which I freely commend to thee, and commit thee to the fellowſhip of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, be thy forme what it will.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Wonderful, O wonderful, folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, folly and madneſs, deceit upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, darkneſs added to blindneſs; and yet how few knoweth their blindneſs, but is pleaſed with a conceit of ſeeing and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This blindneſs is not the loſs of your bodily ſight, O ye ſons of men, for that ſight you have, and by that ſight your luſts have brought blindneſs upon your ſouls; the pure eyes thereof being faſt cloſed, and ſhut up, ſo that pure good you cannot ſee, but in this your blindneſs, you grope even at Noon-day. Light is come amongſt you, yet you ſee it not, neither have you any deſire to ſee it; for your deeds are evil, and therefore you love it not, but you are pleaſed in this your darkneſs, thinking you ſee; and therefore your ſin remaineth untaken from you, <hi>John</hi> 9.41.</p>
            <p>There is a pleaſant object of Light, Life, and Love, amongſt you, yea, and within you; yet do you not ſee it, nor are in the feeling and enjoyment of it, no, nor knoweth not what it is, nor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118484:10"/>where it is; for you be in a blind-ſeeing condition, and in a dead ſenceleſs-feeling condition, and in a lovely hateful condition. O my Friends of my fleſh and blood, I wiſh you all well, but I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can know you, for you are become as Monſters in my ſight; neither dare I come ſo near you, as to touch you, for fear I be devoured by you, for I know your metamorphoſed condition well enough; for I my ſelf have been in the ſame ſhape which you are in, but then I knew it not, but now I know it, and can tell what your nature is; therefore I will not come too near you, but will hide my ſelf among the buſhes, where you ſhall not ſee me; and ſecretly I will watch your moving, and having mine Arrow ready, I will let flie at you; and if they be well aimed, and rightly guided, it may be (poſſible) they will hit ſome of you. I give you warning before-hand, and in ſo doing I may be counted a fool; but yet it is not ſo, for I know all your hiding places, and I am ſure you are ſo well pleaſed with them, that you have no minde to ſtir out of them.</p>
            <p>But it is poſſible when you ſee or hear what I ſay, you will marvel what I mean hereby, and may happily raiſe a queſtion amongſt your ſelves, as Chriſts Diſciples did, when they ſaid, Is it I, is it I, that he meaneth to hit? is it I that am a blinde ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man? is it I that am this metamorphoſed man? is it I that hath a minde ſo fierce, as to devour any of my fleſh and blood? no ſure, he meaneth of ſome other, I am not the man.</p>
            <p>But ſhall I tell you Friends, if you fall to reaſon, as Chriſts Diſciples did, I wiſh there were no more of you, the men I mean of, then one of every twelve; but I rather fear, that the men I mean of, be in number twelve for one; and I will put all men out of the number, but onely thoſe, who profeſs Religion; for thoſe are the men I cheifly aim at, in this my enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; for I ſee them miſhapen and deformed in their Forms and faſhion of Religion, and ſo are become Monſters in the ſame Forms; and ſo are like to degenerated Plants, who bring out fruit fit for no uſe at all, but onely to beguile the fight of the Paſſengers; but when they come to be taſted, they dazzle the head with madneſs, and fill the ſtomach full of rhume, that it cannot digeſt the heavenly food; but in what is ſaid, do not think that I am the enemy of Religion; no, I am not, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, ſo far as God is in it, and as far as thy ſelf is out of it; But when I finde thou haſt choſen thy Religion, and yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118484:10"/>left God out of it, and haſt thy ſelf in thy Religion; there I let flie at thee this my Arrow, what ever thou art, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thy Religion, Form, or Profeſſion be. But this I am ſure of, that I may hit thy head oft enough, before I hurt thee; for thou haſt armor of proof upon it, which thou haſt forged out of ſuch Scriptures, as thou thoughtſt moſt meet for thy uſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, thou haſt hatched and brought out ſome acting in thy choſen Form; and theſe haſt thou covered thy ſelf withal, ſo thou maiſt think thy ſelf ſure enough; yet though thou be thus well harniſhed all about, yet I know where thou art naked, and empty, and that is within thee, even thy heart, and that would I aim at; for though thou be never ſo well armed on thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, yet happily there may be an Arrow drawn at a venture, which may peirce between the coupling of the ſame; but all my fear is, that if a ſhot chance to pierce thorow, that there is ſomething in thee that will not let it pierce thy heart.</p>
            <p>But I will ſpeak no more in parables, but ſhow my meaning openly to thee, <hi>viz.</hi> Thou art about a work in thy Religion, which thou ſhalt never bring to paſs with all the wit or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, reading, praying, acting, in any performance without thee, which all of them, are but things within the compaſs of thine own power, to act or do, as thou art a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But wouldſt thou know what this work is, thou art about, in this thy Religion? I will tell thee what it is (but I queſtion thou wilt not believe me, when thou heareſt it, though it be truth) It is that thou art about to make God and the World dwell together in thy heart; or to ſay, God and thy ſelf, to love and live together within thee; and thou haſt ſo ordered the buſineſs, that thou canſt ſerve them both; but thou art deceived in the matter, for Chriſt himſelf ſaid, thou couldſt not do it; and I know thou knoweſt that Chriſt ſaid ſo: But yet thou knoweſt not, that thou art of that company that is contained within the compaſs of Chriſts words; but thou putteſt it off thy ſelf, and judgeſt ſome other to be guilty herein; for amongſt you all, who are different, and one againſt another in your forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, every one of you judgeth, and condemneth them, who be not of the ſame minde and judgement with you, in your choſen tenet: And who ſo worſhip not God in your own way, you judge him to be inferior to you; for every one of you judge your own opinion chief, and according to what you have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118484:11"/>ſo you worſhip God; and by and through the ſame, you can judge and condemn all others. Are theſe things of God, or man, be judge your ſelves: do you think that God can be divided, or his worſhip parted into peeces, or can Chriſt and his way be ſevered? no, in no caſe. But the thing is not ſtrange, though ſome in our days do marvel to ſee ſo many ſeveral and different judgements, in and about Religion; for thoſe in the Primitive time was carried about, in and by ſuch fooliſh Chimeraes, which did not a little trouble the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1.34. But the Apoſtle knew from whence this ſprang, and tells them plainly they were carnal, and herein he judged rightly; for it is nothing but carnality and earthly-mindedneſs that cauſeth differences amongſt thoſe who profeſs Religion, and yet all pretend the true worſhip of God in the ſame. O fools and unwiſe, when will you learn to be wiſe, and know what is the worſhip of God? you all have heard what Chriſt ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4. and can rehearſe the ſame; but to this day you have been ignorant of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in theſe words: And from hence it is, that you have parted the way of God into ſo many ſeveral kindes of formal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and are ſo ſet in Argument one againſt another; and hereby your ſpeech and language is become changed, whereby you cannot underſtand one another; neither can you help one another, but much hinder one another; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are all of you in ignorance in the work you be a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> No other thing, but building <hi>Babels</hi> Tower, whereby you think to ſave your ſelves from the flood of juſtice, the which ſhall undoubtedly run ove rall fleſh, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.8. By this your worſhip, every one of you think in your hearts to climb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and to get a name one above another; and who can make you believe, That all your ſeemly buildings is nothing elſe but that <hi>Babel,</hi> which one day ſhall fall, and come thundering down about your ears: But though you will not believe me at preſent, yet hereafter I am ſure, you ſhall know the ſame to be true, when you either come to be delivered from the danger you are in, or elſe when the danger hath deſtroyed you; but if you chance to be delivered from the danger, as ſome have been, then ſhall you have the promiſe fulfilled in you, <hi>viz. I will return to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> Zeph. 3.9.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118484:11"/>
            <p>But I make no doubt, but every one of you in your own cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Form, will quickly conceit, that this promiſe is fulfilled on you, and among you, becauſe every one of the ſame ſelf-choſen Form, agree in the ſame, and all bear witneſs with one voice, That the ſame is the onely truth you hold out; and in the ſame Form you have found God, and in the ſame you will own God, and in the ſame you call upon his Name; I know you will, all in your ſeveral Forms, conclude the ſame fulfilled. O friends ſtay a little, and let it be known, if your concluſions be true, yea or nay; for I ſomething doubt you have but a falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words. But canſt thou tell what the work of the Lord is, before he return the pure Language to any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? canſt thou tell what is the voice of this pure Language? I doubt you cannot. But here I will give you a glimpſe, what they both are, if thou have but an eye to ſee, and a heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand when the ſame is ſomwhat held out to thee. Firſt, for the work of the Lord, before he return to any this pure Language, is partly expreſſed in the foregoing verſe of the ſame Chapter, where the Lord ſaith. <hi>Therefore wait ye upon me, until the day Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to the prey; for my determination is to gather the Nations, that I may aſſemble the Kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth ſhall be devoured with the fire of my jealouſie,</hi> Zeph. 3.8. Haſt thou known thy ſoul brought into ſuch a ſad ſorrowful condition, being voide of all help or comfort from all created and things acted? and haſt thou known thy ſoul ſo ſet and compaſſed about with ſin and ſelfneſs, pleaſure, praiſe, and profit, anger, envy, diſcontent both with God and man; roving of thine imagination, thy thoughts, inclinations, and deſires, bended down to created things? hath the want of the lovely preſence of God preſſed thy Spirit ſo ſore, night and day, that both thy ſleep in the night departed from thee, and thy appointed food by day refuſed? hath thy ſoul known it ſelf in captivity thus, in and with theſe things; and haſt thou known thy ſoul in the loweſt Hell, under the chains of ghoſtly death; and haſt thou here born the indignation of the Lord for thy tranſgreſſions; and haſt thou here waited upon the Lord, till he aroſe to the prey, <hi>viz.</hi> To pluck thy ſoul out of the foreſaid captivity; and haſt thou ſeen all theſe thy ghoſtly captivers aſſembled together, and the fierce anger of the Lord poured upon them, and devoured them all; and haſt thou
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118484:12"/>known the fire of his jealouſie, <hi>viz.</hi> Anger and love mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that thereby all created and earthly things was devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thee; ſo that all thy adverſaries and captivers was captived; ſo that Death and Hell is ſwallowed in victory, and that now thy ſoul is carried upon the flying Cherubims; ſo that now thou haſt not a thought, inclination, or deſire, to either profit of the world, praiſe of men, pleaſing of thy ſences or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with any delight; but that as a brand pluckt out of the fire, or as gold ſeven times refined, thy ſoul doth ſo appear before thy God? and then in the clear manifeſtation of the preſence of God, thou ſhalt have this pure language reſtored to thee, <hi>viz.</hi> Then ſhall thy ſoul know how to pronounce <hi>Hallelujah</hi> rightly, then ſhall thy ſoul know how to ſing the new ſong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3. then ſhalt thou know how to call upon the name of the Lord, for then thou ſhalt know what is his name, becauſe the ſame ſhall be written in thy forehead, <hi>viz.</hi> In the noble faculty of thy ſoul, even thy pure underſtanding; for then thou ſhalt know truly, that his Name is Wonderful, Mighty, and Merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo ſhalt praiſe him according to the knowledge of his Name. But I will proceed no further in ſhowing the nature of the pure Language, nor what is to be done in every ſoul, before it ſhall have that Language returned; for by this glimpſe, thoſe that have it, can teſtifie the truth hereof, and ſo can expreſs what I mean, becauſe they underſtand my minde, by what is already ſaid, and then there is enough; and to thoſe who know it not, nor believe it, becauſe they have not known the ſame, I ſuppoſe, if more had been ſaid, it had but been loſt labor, and ſo to them this is enough alſo. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed dare I explain any further; for now in theſe days, the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comprehending devil is let looſe, and he hath got into the wit of men, and there he ſitteth like a God, and teacheth men how they ſhall learn this pure Language, and new Song, when they hear the ſame ſpoken or ſung, by thoſe who have the ſame returned to them: But yet this cunning devil in the wit of men doth not teach any thing, but onely a ſound of words; for all the Devils in Hell, nor all the wit and learning of men, nor all the Angels in Heaven, can return to man this pure Language, nor teach this new Song unto any ſoul, until it be redeemed from the earth and earthly things, and till it be cloathed in the white robe, and follow the Lamb whether ſoever he goeth; and that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118484:12"/>have the white ſtone with the new Name, <hi>which no man knoweth, but he that hath it;</hi> and none can teach this Language, <hi>but the Lamb ſlain from the beginning, &amp;c.</hi> But I have digreſſed too far from the thing intended; but yet in my digreſſing I have a ſecret aim, <hi>viz.</hi> To pitch ſomething before the eyes of thoſe, whom I aim to ſhoot at afterward, that while they be looking at what is ſet before them, I may come the better to hit my mark; for my Bow is ready bent, and the Arrow of the Almighty is ſet in it, and who cometh firſt in view, I will let it flie at them, whether I hit or miſs.</p>

               <head>A Spiritual Viſion of the Presbytery, and all other Forms without God, included in it.</head>
               <p>BUt methink I hear a voice ſpeaking, as though it were ſpoken by thoſe who are of the Presbytery order; and thus I hear them ſpeak. Indeed it is true, The Lord had need to ſhoot out his Arrows at the wicked, for they are mightily increaſed at this time, for the poor Church, and pure Church of Chriſt is like to be ſwallowed up by the power of ſtrange wicked Sectaries, who are riſen up in theſe days; and the reaſon is becauſe of an unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parliament, whom we too much truſted to, for they have ſwarved from the truſt we committed to them; but if we had known, how they would have proved, we would never have acted ſo againſt the King; for we little knew then what priviledge we had, though our power was not ſo great as we ſhould have had, and which did wholly belong to us, we being the onely people of God, and had knowledge to govern both Church and State; but the Parliament being metamorphiſed from the ſhape of Holineſs, they have given Liberty of Conſcience to every one in their Religion, and will not execute Juſtice upon men, when they erre from the Faith which we have: And this was their blindneſs and ignorance in adhering too much to that beaſt ſet out in the <hi>Revelation</hi> 13. <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Cromwel</hi> and a ſort of wicked Sectaries under him, who by their power have brought the Saints into bondage; but if the Parliament had but ſtood to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118484:13"/>their firſt principles of Faith, which we profeſs, all theſe had been ſurpriſed; for then had our power been ſtrong, and our power is terrible as an Army with Banners, againſt all who will not worſhip God in our way; For our way of worſhip is the onely way of worſhip in all the world, and all other are but erring Sects.</p>
               <p>We helped both with our Prayers, Blood, and Purſes, to overthrow the whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the King, and his wicked rabble; but now far worſe is riſen up in their place, and by thoſe we be more perplexed then ever, for they have taken away our power, by which we upheld the Faith, and ſo are become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very ill condition; for we are no more but a mock amongſt the people, and we ſtand but as cyphers; nay, which is worſt of all, many of our own Faith declineth from us, and adhereth to theſe new-come Sects: And thus the pure Church becometh rent in peeces, and all is becauſe we want our power to compel, and to execute juſtice upon the oppoſers; but ſeeing it is ſo, we will wait with patience, for this is but the tryal of the Church, for we know that hereafter our God will deliver us; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe things be faln upon us, yet have we not departed from the way of our God, nor dealt unfaithfully in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; nay, we appeal to our God for witneſs, who knoweth our hearts, that we keep cloſe to our Religious worſhipping of him; for neither do we allow of any to be our Paſtors, but ſuch as have come in by the right door, men choſen of God, made fit by the godly Univerſities, confirmed by the approbation, and laying on of the hands of our holy Presbytery; and ſuch we receive according to their worth, and theſe and none other can ſpeak the Language of Chriſt to us, and with them we joyn in hearing them both Preach, and Pray, and in the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in which we have our Faith confirmed to our ſouls, finding them very much comforted thereby; ſo that we are made able to walk in holineſs of life, and perform all holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to our God; and he in his loving kindneſs anſwers us again in giving us his holy Spirit to inſpire us, and by that Spirit we are made ſure of our Salvation, and know that we are elected from eternity, and by that Spirit we call God Father, and Chriſt our Brother, and Mediator; and in this we rejoyce continually, walking in the ways of our God in holy life, and Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, making our calling and election ſure by well-doing.</p>

               <p>Hearing this voice, I muſed a little, and thought in my ſelf, there is an appearance of ſome godlineſs here, I will hold my hand, and not ſhoot at ſuch a holy object as this, before I very well underſtand the truth of the matter; for ſaid I, it is not for me to ſhoot out this Arrow, but againſt them that God aimeth it for, and thoſe be ſuch as are his enemies; therefore I will conſider a little, and ſee what the minde of the Lord is, before I let out this Arrow.</p>
               <p>But not long had I conſidered hereupon, till there was brought before my ſight the object that had thus ſpoken; and it ſeemed in appearance no leſs then what was expreſſed by the voice, and me-thought there was much of God in it: For it had a godly garb upon it, a fair covering it was to look upon, wrought with divers works, and variety of colours, all of them ſeeming to be dyed in grain, and well-grounded: So drawing ſomewhat nearer to behold this comly Garment, the nearer I came to it, the worſe it ſeemed; and in the skirts of it, I eſpied much blood. And I likewiſe ſaw, that all the various work was but a gloſs, ſet on by the cunning of ſome witty Painter, who had been very cunning in that art: But while I was looking, there was a voice ſaid, Look what thou ſeeſt under, and within that garb; and ſo the garb was ſomewhat drawn aſide, and under it I ſaw a monſtrous Creature, which is called <hi>Self;</hi> and this Monſter had as many heads and horns as the Beaſt which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the <hi>Revelation:</hi> And this Monſter was cloſed faſt to the heart, and kept it under its power, and captivity. I ſaw alſo other Beaſts with divers heads and horns, and I ſaw ſeveral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithites engraven upon theſe heads, as namely, <hi>Cruelty, Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding, Perſecution, Pride, Love of the World, Love of praiſe, Love of honor, Envy, Anger, Impatience, Murmuration, Hatred toward God and his people, Hard-heartedneſs, Carnal-mindedneſs, Ignorance of God, Self-conceitedneſs, Good thinking, &amp;c.</hi> And out of, and from amongſt theſe, I ſaw a chain come from the Monſter called <hi>Self,</hi> and it reached out to the fair ſeeming Garment, and kept the garment faſt about theſe other Beaſts, ſo that they could not be diſcovered; and this chain conſiſted of five links, <hi>viz.</hi> Falſe Faith, falſe Love, and falſe Hope, and falſe fear of God, and falſe-feeling of inward Joy; and the name of that chain was called <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> And I ſaw one of the Beaſts before ſaid, and he was like a Leopard, and his name was <hi>Self-wiſdom;</hi> and I ſaw
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118484:14"/>another of theſe Beaſts, and he was like a Dragon, and his name was <hi>Self-power.</hi> And I ſaw another of theſe Beaſts, and he was ſomewhat ſeemlier then the reſt, having two horns like a Lamb; and his name was called <hi>Self-righteouſneſs.</hi> And theſe three I ſaw in Unity conſulting together, and I heard their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation; and it was againſt the moſt high God, and againſt his own people. And I ſaw the work they wrought, and all their work was to make Robes and Garbs to hide themſelves under them; and ſo I ſaw how they had wrought this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aforeſaid, and the ſtuff they uſed in making it; for it was made of ten ſeveral mixtures, <hi>viz.</hi> Sanctifying the Sabbath, hearing of their Miniſter, Praying two times each day, refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from groſs acting, keeping from the company of the wicked, aſſembling together to repetitions, receiving the thing they call a Sacrament, otherwiſe called Bread and Wine, Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or the ſome ſmall charity to thoſe they call godly, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their outward eyes towards the Element in their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reproving of other who worſhip not God in theſe things. And all theſe are mixt together, and made up very handſomly by, and with a work-tool, <hi>viz.</hi> Seeming zeal for the glory of God. And I ſaw who helped to put this Garment on, and he had a look as though he had been ſore frighted, and ſeemed as one, who was not a very wiſe one; and his name was called <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And I ſaw a Girdle that kept that Garment cloſe to them that wore it; and that was called <hi>Fear of Hell.</hi> And on this Garment I ſaw a badge or mark, as though it had been the Livery of ſome great man, and his arms engraven therein, and in that badge there was this Epithite engraven, <hi>viz. The Saints ſign,</hi> and this was called <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And I ſaw an hollow Pipe that was faſtned to this Garment, and that went inward, and the end that went inward, and reached to the mouth of the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature, that help to put on the Garment, <hi>viz. Conſcience,</hi> and he was pleaſed, and delighted to be ſucking and drawing at that Pipe; for there iſſued from the vertue of that Garment, a certain ſweetneſs, which diſtilled through that Pipe, and with that was he well pleaſed, and by it his frighting looks was changed in ſmiles; and by this he was ſatisfyed, and ſat in great ſilence and quietneſs: Now the name of this Pipe was called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregarding of the heart,</hi> and the oyl or vertue that paſſed there-through, was called <hi>Secret reflecting upon outward actings;</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118484:14"/>and when Conſcience was well ſatisfied by the vertue he ſucketh through that Pipe, then doth he reſt; and to ſalute him in his peace, I ſaw the three former Beaſts, <hi>viz. Self-wiſdom, ſelf-power,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs:</hi> And I ſaw an unclean ſpirit attend them, and he was like a Lamp, and ſhined like a lightning, and they all were compaſſed about with that light; and this ſpirit was called <hi>The Angel of darkneſs transformed into an Angel of light;</hi> and amongſt them there was great triumph and mirth, and this was called <hi>Seeming joy in the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And I ſaw them make a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Law or Act amongſt themſelves, to which they all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and they ſealed it with the promiſes; and they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the Conſcience to be kept, and they grounded this act upon antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> Predeſtination, and Eternal decree: And this act was like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> for it was concluded by them, it ſhould never be broken. And this Law was named, <hi>Full aſſurance of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when I had ſeen and heard all this, it was ſaid unto me, Behold and underſtand, for this is no other then the Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity, hid under outward Formality; and to this day it hath been undiſcovered, amongſt moſt of thoſe who profeſs the name of Religion. Therefore bend thy Bow, and let thoſe Arrows committed to thee, flie abroad; if thou hit, or miſs, do not thou care, for I will be thy warrant; fear not what may be done, or ſpoken againſt thee; be not backward in delivering what is committed to thee.</p>
               <p>Now my Bow being ready bent, and the Arrow committed to me, I let flie at thee thou falſe-hearted <hi>Presbytery,</hi> thou which couzeneſt them that adhere to thee. Come and let me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate the buſineſs with thee; for it ſeemeth thou muſt be called in queſtion before the face of the moſt High; and before thou be called thither, let me give thee warning to repent of thy folly, and learn in time to ſee how thou art befooled in, and with thy own conceit. Thou wilt hardly believe that this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Myſtery is in thy heart; for thou haſt never found it there, for thou haſt covered thy ſelf from it, with thy outward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality; and if thou have but half an eye open, I will let thee ſee thy forms is nothing but things of, and within thy own power to act; and that they be all or moſt of them but ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon rotten foundations of thy own wiſdoms invention; and that thou art carried on in them, by thine own good think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118484:15"/>whereby thou art become the enemy of God, whatever thou pretend.</p>
               <p>And firſt I will draw my Bow at thy <hi>Prieſts;</hi> but this name they will not own, becauſe (ſay they) it doth not belong to them, for it is a ceremonial eptithite; yet I ſay, thou needſt not diſlike them; for it were well if thou wert a Prieſt indeed, for then ſhouldſt thou be that ſpiritually, which the Prieſts in the time of the Law were ceremonially; and thou ſhouldſt do that office, and offer theſe gifts ſpiritually, which they did cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially. And this then ſhouldſt thou be (which I fear thou art not) one redeemed from the earth, and thy ſins would be waſhed from thee by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. But this name thou wilt not own; and indeed thou doſt well in not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, for it doth not belong to thee. But yet I know what name thou wilt own, <hi>viz.</hi> a Miniſter of the Goſpel; but this name thou doſt but aſſume to thy ſelf, for thou knoweſt not what the Goſpel is, neither was (or is) it committed to thee to deliver; therefore thou canſt not give to others, that which thou wanteſt thy ſelf; but I will tell thee what thy right name is, if thou wilt but own it, and that name is a taker from men, that which thou haſt no right to have: And if this ſhould be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, thy proper name would prove none other, then the name theft. And I am ſure, if I or any other ſhould out take an hundred ſhillings from any man, which I or they had no right to take; and yet as good right to take it as thou haſt to take an hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> I know by the Law of the Land, I or he ſhould be hanged for ſo doing; yea, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it too: then be thine own judge, what thou deſerveſt, for taking ſo much unjuſtly every year. But I know how thou wilt avoide this, and clear thy ſelf of being this great theif; for thou wilt ſay, thou haſt nothing but what belongeth to thee of right, and thou wilt prove it by Scripture too, having the word of the Apoſtle to back thine Argument; where he ſaith by way of compariſon, <hi>Who goeth a warfare at any time, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. And likewiſe he uſeth other metaphors, As he that plougheth, and threſheth, ſhould be partaker of his hope; and I kewiſe he bringeth in the compariſon of ſowing ſpiritual things: And further he ſaith, The Lord hath ſo ordained that they that Preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is as much as thou canſt properly alleage for thy ſelf in thy doing,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118484:15"/>to keep thee from being guilty of being a theif; and thou thinkeſt this will be thy warrant for what thou doſt; for I know thy interpretation of theſe words well enough, and thou underſtandeſt them as well as thou doſt the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and both alike; but I pray thee hearken, and I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſame unto thee truly. But it may be thou wilt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth when thou heareſt it ſpoken; for if it pleaſe thee not, thou wilt queſtion, that I have not been at the Univerſity to get my ſpirit inſpired, thereby to underſtand Scripture rightly: But let my inſpiration come from what Fountain it is come from, at preſent I will not give thee account from whence I had it; but minde thou what I here hold out to thee, and let me give thee out the truth of the thing in hand. In the firſt place, I would have thee to conſider who the Apoſtle meaneth on, when he ſpake theſe words. Was it thoſe that preached Chriſt by hear-ſay, and by Schollerſhip, and their own brain-knowledge gathered from the works and words of other men, and that chuſed out one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Scripture as thou doſt, and falleth to thy wit, ſtudying the minde of God in it, and ſo divideth one ſentence into ſo many ſeveral fractions, and out of each to raiſe out Doctrines, Uſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo declaring the minde of God, and Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own Schollerſhip, Wit, and Knowledge got from Scriptures and other mens labors: Thinkeſt thou it was ſuch he meaneth of, or did intend theſe words for them? if thou do, thou art a fool. But I will tell thee who he aimed them for, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as himſelf; who had the right knowledge of, and lived in the power of what he held out to others, and had not his doctrine to fetch out of his ſtudy and brain-knowledge, gotten from what others had ſaid; but he had it from the right Fountain, that Fountain living in him, and he in it; and he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that he lived in, and could witneſs the truth thereof truly; and as he had heard and ſeen, ſo did he teſtifie to others; for he had ſeen the Lord Jeſus in Spirit, and he had felt his love, and lived in that love; and from thence he had his freedom, both to ſpeak, and talk what was freely given him by thoſe whom he had brought to be partakers of the ſpiritual bleſſing, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſhedding abroad of the love of God in their hearts; by which love, they were more willing to give, then he was to receive: And theſe people he ſpoke theſe words to, were wrought into the ſame condition, as himſelf witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118484:16"/>therefore knowing that he was one whom the Lord had ſent to work his work, and that the work was wrought, even upon thoſe, upon whom this work was fulfilled, he thought no great offence to take what they would freely give him; and to ſuch whom he had wrought up into the faith and love of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he ſheweth, that if he did take any thing of them, yet he did not tranſgreſs; and to ſhew them how reaſonable it was, if he did ſo, he brings before them theſe foreſaid metaphors, which all of them being rightly weighed, was worthy of the reward they hoped for; and from thence he draweth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That it was as lawful for him to take ſomething of them, as a Souldier to take the wages he ventureth his life for: And as reaſonable it was, as for the Husband-man to eat of the fruit of his own labor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Law of Reaſon will allow this.</p>
               <p>Well, this may ſound ſomething as like thou wouldſt have it, but minde what is ſaid before, and what cometh afterward, and then ſee where thou art; for thou art not the man that hath the right to take of any, any thing for what thou doſt, for thy work is not worth a Bodwill <hi>per annum;</hi> for thou art not the man that hath any due at all to a peny for thy work; for thy work is but thy own, and thou haſt learned it, as men learn other trades; and yet by what thou haſt learned from others, thou wilt take upon thee to enter upon the work of the Lord, and to be a declarer of his will and minde to others, whereas thou beareſt but falſe witneſs of the minde of God; for thou haſt not ſeen the Lord Jeſus; neither ever did he call thee to what thou doſt, nor ever hath the minde of Chriſt Jeſus been made known unto thee in the Myſterious manifeſtation of his loving kindneſs to thy ſoul; neither doſt thou live in the life of, and love of God, and ſo thou art far enough from knowing what his will is; for he doth not own thee in thy work, neither will he bleſs thy work, for it is none of his, but thy own; and ſo thy own bleſſing falleth upon it, and that is nothing but a falſe name thou putteſt upon it, making fooliſh people believe thou art ſomething, even <hi>Simon Magus</hi> like, who deceived the people: And thou makeſt ſome believe that thou haſt converted them to God, (yea, and thou art ſo perſwaded thy ſelf too) when alas they are but the ſame they were in their hearts, onely they differ from what they were before in the outward man;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118484:16"/>and becauſe thou haſt put out their eyes, they give up themſelves to be led by thy direction; and for ſo doing, thou doſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them bleſſed; but yet poor ſouls, their hearts are not turned to God, but live in the world.</p>
               <p>Look back I pray thee, at the foreſaid Myſtery, and the fair Garment; for they be the very emblems and juſt pictures of thy ſelf, and thy converts; for all which thou teacheſt, and what they learn of thee, is but to work that Garment; and both thou and they pretend what you will of God, your work is but your own, and the creature may go ſo far, and farther too, by the power in them by Creation, the common grace added to it; and all this you boaſt of is, but the Creatures acting, and in this you have but made them twofold more the childe of Satan, then they were before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15. And you are the very men that heal the wounds of the people very ſlightly, <hi>Jere.</hi> 8.11. But take to you, and lay it to heart, for the ſaying of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth belong onely to you (and ſuch as you) for he ſaith, <hi>If the blinde lead the blinde, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 15.14.</p>
               <p>And this is all you bring to paſs, to deceive the ſouls of the people. And thus you pay them for their hire, and this is the work you work for your wages; and theſe are the ſpiritual things you ſow to them, whereby you imbolden your ſelves to take their carnal things; and this is the Goſpel you preach, whereby you get your living; and yet you cannot ſee how you are blinded, but runne on in your ſin, ſtrengthning your ſelves with the wrong underſtanding of the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; whereas you neither be the man he was, neither inwardly nor outwardly, neither have you the right calling into theſe places you are in, neither do you work the work he wrought; and yet do you moſt unjuſtly take an occaſion from his Word, to take from the people, that which belongeth not unto you; but being partial in your own cauſe, you take in Scripture what may ſeem to make for your own gain, and what ſeemeth to be againſt you, that you wave, and will not minde it. For though the Apoſtle by right of his calling, and rightneſs of his work, might have received ſomething of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as due to him as the Souldiers wages, yet he kept himſelf free from receiving any thing of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Yea, his own hands miniſtered to his neceſſity, as may be ſeen, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.34. But this you take no notice of, becauſe if you ſhould follow his example, your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118484:17"/>would fall down, and that you have no minde to let fail.</p>
               <p>But in this your doing, I aſſure you, That you are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt theeves in all the world, nay, you are both theeves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yea, and the greateſt cheaters in the world too, and I will prove it too.</p>
               <p>For firſt, you take of the people that you have no right to take, becauſe it doth not belong to you, as is partly ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and as ſhall be made more manifeſt afterward; and ſo taking from others, that which is not yours, herein are you not theeves? be judge your own ſelves.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe you keep the people from entering into the Kingdom of Heaven; for you neither will enter your ſelves, and thoſe that would enter, you will not ſuffer, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.52. For while you binde up the people under your forms, and are not able to bring them out, and beyond theſe forms, you keep the people in thick darkneſs, and ſo ſhut the gates of the Kingdom againſt them, and they cannot enter in for you. And in this you rob God of the ſouls of the people, ſo that he loſeth his honor, and praiſe in them. And thus are you become robbers, both the people of the Kingdom of Heaven, and God of the glory and honor of his people.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, you are cheaters; for you make the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is the Word of God you Preach unto them, when it is but the froth of your own brain, and the fruit of your ſtudies, and an hiſtorical relation of the Scriptures, and ſpeakings of other men. And herein you deceive the people, for the Word of God is his Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2. and him you have not known; and therefore the Word is hid from you.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe you ſhape out a Faith to the people by your own fancy, and you frame them a love of God, according to your own faſhion; and you teach them the fear of God by your own precepts, and make them believe that all is right you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to them; and herein you mightily cheat the people.</p>
               <p>But I know your blindneſs is ſo great, and your ears ſo dull of hearing, and your hearts ſo groſs, you will neither ſee, nor hear, nor underſtand the truth, though one tell it you; for like the deaf Adder you ſtop your ears, ſo that you will not hear the <hi>voice of the charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely, Pſal.</hi> 51.5. For I know you think your ſelves the onely called Men, and ſent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118484:17"/>Miniſters of God; and all that cometh to declare the Way and Word of God, and cometh not in by your door, theſe will you count theeves and robbers, and that they take upon them, that which doth not belong to them; but let ſuch as theſe come in at what door they will, I pray you hearken to me, and I will tell you, in at what door you have entred, and to this day do enter.</p>
               <p>But I will not reckon your pedigree, or predeceſſory too far, for fear I draw your line to reach to the Devil himſelf, who is the onely or chief oppoſer of the truth, <hi>as it is in Jeſus;</hi> for thou wouldſt think this too harſh a cenſure upon you, though I could prove the ſame to be true; and yet becauſe you would queſtion, that I could not prove the truth of what I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, I will give you a general touch of the truth of the ſame, but wil not meddle too far in particulars herein, for fear I ſhame you too much; and far be it from me to ſeek your ſhame fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to let you ſee your folly, if ſo be you might be made to ſee it, and forſake it. For I profeſs in the preſence of God, I love you ſo far as I ſee ought of God in you, and pity you, where I ſee you carried from him by your own blindneſs, and do heartily wiſh your welfare: and do not count me your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>I know full well from whence your ſelves derive or pretend to have your ground, for what you do, and what you ſpeak; and for your inſtitutions, I know you wil ſay, from the Primitive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and example: It is true, you have ſome grounds from thence, for your chooſing of Elders, if you were the men fit for ſuch a work, but as you are not the men fit for that work, thoſe that are made Elders by you, are but ſuch as your ſelves; all of you blindly taking that upon you, which doth not belong to you; and ſo you onely have ſtoln that Form, but yet the power is wanting in you; and no marvel, For if the Fountain be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the ſtreams cannot be pure.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, you gather from thence your warrant for laying on of hands upon thoſe you think meet to be Miniſters, as you call them: It is true, there was ſuch a thing in thoſe days, but to whom did it belong? not to them who would have had it either by ſtealth or purchaſe; for none had this committed to them, but that received it of God, by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt; and thoſe that had that gift, had power to communicate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118484:18"/>the ſame to thoſe upon whom they lay their hand; but this you have not, neither can you give it to others on whom you lay your hand, for you have not your calling from him that calls them, and yet as in other things, you in your fool-hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe aſſume this thing to your ſelves; and as you want the power, the forme is but weake, and not worth a ſtraw, nay, the very forme of theſe doe not belong to you, for you have but ſtolne it; for looke into the Primitive time, and ſee the laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and you ſhall ſee he left theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions in the power and hands of the order of Biſhops, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> being ordained ſuch, and to them was both theſe and other orders committed, and in thoſe dayes the head of Presbytery was a Biſhop, and he was firſt in matter of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but you have broken off from the Biſhops, and have taken that to your ſelves, that which was commited to them.</p>
               <p>But let me ſhew you in a few words the originall from whence your calling (into the Miniſtry) cometh: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When the world by wiſdome knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſave them that beleeve,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. and this preaching in thoſe dayes was the holding out the wiſdome, and power, and righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, and thoſe who were to be the Preachers or promulgaters of theſe, were none but thoſe who had received the ſame thing which they held out to others, and could beare witneſſe to the truth of what they did deliver, and this ſeemed to be nothing to the wiſe of the world, for they ſavoured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, nor heard any thing in it to pleaſe their curious eares, for it wanted method, and eloquency, and curioſity of Art, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe was called a babler, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18. but to thoſe who was called it was the power of God, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1.24. and ſo long as the Primitive Church remained in purity, thoſe who were the Miniſters and declarers of the Word of God, had the ſame word abiding in them, working and opperating in them, by which they were made able to demonſtrate unto others what they themſelves was made partakers of.</p>
               <p>And as ancient Records beare witneſſe, the <hi>Romans</hi> kept longeſt in that purity, and in the inſtitutions, but in time the beaſt Selfeneſſe begun to ſtirre, being moved by the Devill, and ſo the power of God began to with-draw it ſelfe, and then the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118484:18"/>purity cenſed, and only the forme of the Primitive Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was left amongſt, and ſo in time as Selfe got head, and grew ſtrong, the ſelfe wiſdome began to creep in, and added abundance more of new inſtitutions which remaine amongſt them to this day.</p>
               <p>In which time, when the power and purity had drawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the wiſdome of the fleſh got up, and invented a new way of preaching Chriſt; for the fooliſh way, viz. the living powerfull, experimentall ſpeaking was with-drawn, and then the wiſdome of the fleſh invented another way, and that was the wiſe way of preaching Chriſt, viz. by learning and ſtudy, and thoſe that was to be the Miniſters was to be trained up in their greateſt Schooles, untill ſuch time as they were able to ſpeake, and underſtand Languages, and able to make Speeches and Orations out of ſmall grounds, and able to derive words, and divide words and ſentences into ſo many ſeverall parts, and to raiſe a large ſpeech out of every part, and to confirme the truth of each ſeverall ſpeech by Authors, whom they had and have ſtill for that very purpoſe: and when any was become thus learned and wiſe, then might he be admitted to preach Chriſt to the people, but not elſe; and when they were thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and admitted into the Miniſtery, they were aſſigned to ſome place to officiate in their Function, and eſtabliſhed in good Benefices, and thus became Chriſt to bee taught in the wiſe way, and the Preachers well paid for their labour.</p>
               <p>And though you at this day degenerate ſo farre from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet your Anceſtors ſprung from amongſt them, being ſomewhat refined from the groſſe ſuperſtition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which you and they make ſo much difference; but if you knew your ſelves, you need not to differ ſo much with them, for you are both one in your hearts, and you differ not but in your heads, and thus when you were a little refined in ſome of your formes, yet did your fore-fathers chuſe to themſelves that which might make them great in the world, viz. power, praiſe, and profit, and the wiſe way of preaching Chriſt, for that was and is the thing that brought both praiſe and profit in amongſt you: and though your fathers differed with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about thoſe things which cauſe theſe jarres, yet your Fathers could follow their example in things that made for their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, praiſe, and profit; and to theſe dayes in which we live, you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118484:19"/>follow the ſteps of your fore-fathers: And thus have you prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt by Schollerſhip and Art, and ſo God is unknowne amongſt his people. becauſe the fooliſh preaching of Chriſt hath been kept downe by the wiſe preaching of the Fleſh; and thus are you become the blinders of the people, and lead them from the knowledge of both God and themſelves, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of preaching Chriſt unto them; and poore ſoules, all this while you have but made them beleeve lyes, and have filled their mouthes with gravell ſtones inſtead of bread, and you have ſo inchanted them with your Charmes, that they are pleaſed with what you offer to them, and are content to be fed, and live upon thoſe husks you provide them; and you have ſo brought their pallats out of taſte that they cannot well taſte any other food; but it is but now as it was ſome times before, for the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lived in ſuch a time, as his owne words teſtifie, where he ſaith, <hi>The Prophets prophecy falſly, and the Prieſts beare rule by their meanes, and my people love to have it ſo, Jerem.</hi> 3.31. but I will not expound theſe words, but leave them to your ſelves, and if you pleaſe you may carry them to your Univerſities to expound, if you cannot expound them your ſelves; but I am ſure neither you, nor your Univerſities will ſay, that the Prophet meant of either of you, or the people in your dayes, that love your Doctrine ſo well; but though I will not expound theſe words of the Prophet, yet I will give an anſwer to the queſtion he asketh: After theſe words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he asking what the end of theſe things would be; to which I ſay, deſtruction ſhall ſurely come upon People, Prieſt, and Prophet, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I deſire you to heare a little more of your calling into your Office, for now I will ſpeake to your owne experience, and you cannot deny that; yea, and I will prove good what I ſay by witneſſes, who knoweth that what I ſay is no lye, and my witneſſes ſhall not be any that you will take to bee your enemies, for they ſhall be your owne naturall Parents if they be alive, and will but ſpeake truth; but what muſt they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? nothing elſe but what they intended when firſt they put you to the holy Univerſity, to learne how you ſhould become preachers of Chriſt, and to underſtand the minde of God, that thereby you might teach others Gods wayes, I know if they wil but ſpeake, and beare true witneſſe upon this examination, they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118484:19"/>will ſay they knew it was the beſt trade in the Land to put their Sons to, for after you had learned your trade, they knew you might have good trading for the Art, for they knew there was good wages for the worke, for they ſaw good fat Benefices e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now in the Land, and they made no doubt but ſome of them would fall to your ſhare; beſide, you ſhould be honoured of the people too, and be called Rabby, ſo if your Fathers would but ſpeake truth, they would witneſſe it was their pride, and covetous intent that firſt moved them to put you to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and this I thinke you will beleeve, and ſo your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers having eaten ſoure Grapes, your teeth alſo is ſet on edge, and your actings ſhew what was in your Fathers hearts when they firſt put you to the trade; and I aſſure you that you are good thriving children, and be loath that your Fathers ſhould miſſe of what they intended, for you will not let it fall on your ſide, for if you have not a Benefice that is great enough, when you have opportunity, and ſee way for a better, you will leave the leſſe for the greater; for if at preſent you have a place that yeeldeth fifty or threeſcore pound <hi>per annum,</hi> in caſe one fall in your way worth an hundred or ſix ſcore pound <hi>per annum,</hi> then will you leave the leſſe, and take the greater, and ſo a hundred you will change for a hundred and fifty, and the hundred and fifty you will change for two hundred, and in ſo doing, you will pretend you are called of God from one place to another, and herein you lye not, for that God that called you to the Office, calleth you from one place to another, and that is the god Mammon, who firſt with his inſpirations inſpired your Fathers to make you what you are, and your Fathers god is your god alſo, and his inſpirations you obey, and that with all your ſouls and ſtrength, for in caſe you have not a benefice at preſent that ſatisfies your hungry deſire, when there is any appearance of a greater to be gotten, O what inſpiration doth your god caſt into your mindes, and then is your deſires inlarged, and your thoughts ſet on worke, how to anſwer your god in his inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then you humble your ſelfe under the mighty hand of your god, in which humility you come bending before this great man, and that great man, and ſo deſireth his helpe and countenance in the matter; and by their meanes you come to get your matter brought about to what you would have had it. Is not this true? I appeale to your ſelves for witneſſe hereof;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118484:20"/>for though you would, yet you cannot turne your eyes from it, for your owne Conſcience will witneſſe this for a truth. O wretched, and moſt miſerable of all men in your doings, how dare you ſay, that God hath ſent you to ſpeake in his Name, or take upon you the name of Chriſt's Miniſters, ſeeing how cleare it is from whence you had your calling, and how baſe you are in your calling, but yet you cannot ſee your ſelves in your baſeneſſe, for your god hath blinded your eyes, neither doe you care for having them opened, while you make ſo good a trade of your ſpeaking, for that ſpirit of divination that poſſeſſeth you, bringeth in you no little gaine by its ſmooth ſpeaking, for many of you ſell your ſpeaking at no leſſe rate then three or foure pound a Sermon, as ſome call it, but let it be what it will, I ſay ſome of you have ſo much for ſpeaking one houre, and if any of you get but ten or twenty ſhillings for each Sermon, you thinke that hardly well ſold, yet you all pretend the honour of God, and the edifying of the people, and the feeding of their ſoules; O fooles, for ſhame hold your tongues, and ſay not ſo: but you declare your ſins like <hi>Sodome,</hi> and cannot hide them from God, nor from them who have their eyes open. And would but the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> make an Act, to take away this hire from you, and that you might have nothing from them for your ſpeaking, then ſhould you ſee your ſelves, and all the world might ſee you; for then wee ſhould but heare little of you, for your preaching would bee ſoone at an end, and Gods honour, and the edifying of his people would quickly ceaſe, and then I beleeve you would let a Souldier take the Pulpit, for you would not care who came in it then; then would it appeare from whom, and from whence you had your calling, and I thinke that the Parliament would doe God a ſpeciall peice of ſervice in making ſuch an Act, and I am perſwaded God would mightily bleſſe them for it, for in ſo doing they ſhould over-throw as great enemies of God, and his Truth, as ever yet was ſubdued (in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi>) and theſe enemies are the pride and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of theſe covetous Prieſts; but this is my hope, that this Act will once be brought to paſſe, for God will not paſſe ſuch dealing by though he ſuffer long, for his patience is well nigh tired out.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour ſaw theſe men well enough, and you, whom I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118484:20"/>have written to, are the very ſame in your generation, whom he calleth the hireling, who runneth away when he ſeeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the ſheep to the wolf, <hi>John</hi> 10.12. Is not this your very practiſe, when any poverty or ſuffering ſeemeth to come upon you, which you diſcern by the eyes of your fleſhly reaſon; and when you can but know of a place to hide your ſelves from that apparant danger, then away you run, and let what as will take the people, Dogs, Wolves, or Devils, you care not; for you will fend for your ſelves, and you will ſay God calleth you from them. And thus you run from one place to another, one while for fear of poverty, or ſome other ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes for the maintaining and upholding of your pride. And all this is becauſe you are hirelings, for the ſheep is not yours; for you neither were ſent by God, neither do you work his work in begetting ſouls to God; and as you have not the love of God manifeſted in you, you cannot beget children, nor bring them forth into the partaking of the love of God; for you have not that immortal ſeed of God in you, to ſow in the hearts of others: And therefore you are but barren and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo your hearers are but empty ſouls, not knowing what the love of God is; and therefore there can be no true love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and them; and therefore upon ſmall occaſions you will leave them. But were they children begotten by you, you would loſe your life before you would run away from them, and you would ſpend and be ſpent for them, and endure any hardſhip for, and amongſt them: But you are but Miniſters of fortune, and thoſe that will give moſt for your ſervice, may have it; and as long as you can profit well by the people, you will ſerve them, and pretend much love to them; and herein you make but a prey of the flock, and ſeem like Lambs and Sheep in your appearance to them, when you profit well by them: And thus you ſlily beguile the poor, and devour, and take from them by your ravening, that which many of them might very ill ſpare, and yet have it you will.</p>
               <p>Conſider I pray you of the words of our Saviour, for you are the ſelf-ſame he pointeth out, where he ſaith, <hi>Beware of falſe-prophets that ſhall come in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves: But by their fruits you ſhall know them, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 7.15, 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this very ſame is fulfilled in you; for your fruits do teſtifie what you are; for you have not brought out fruit unto
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118484:21"/>God, but unto your ſelves, and you are no more but like to thorns and thiſtles, who tear the wool of ſheep, and your fruit not worth the gathering. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> before his departure had a clear ſight of you, and of your fore-fathers, and told the people, <hi>That after his departure ſhould grievous wolves ariſe, not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the flock, Acts</hi> 20.29. Is not this true in you, in tearing and taking away the poor mans labor; and if you have but the tenth part, you care not what becomes of the poor mans family at home; when oft it hapneth, that his children wanteth bread, and other neceſſaries for what you have taken from them, to conſume upon your pride and luſt. I can witneſs to this truth my ſelf, and ſo can many others in <hi>England;</hi> but if we can but have patience a little, all will be amended, and then ſhall you no longer reign; for your deſolation is not far off, and I would have you to take notice of it; for I warrant you, what I ſay is no Aſtrology, for that you will not believe, though never ſo true. But this that I tell you, ſhall undoubtedly come to paſs, and ſooner perhaps then you look for it. I will not tell you at preſent, what I believe of you, leaſt when it cometh to paſs, you ſay I was a witch; for I know you will not allow a true ſpeaker the name of Prophet.</p>
               <p>But me thinks I hear ſome of you object and ſay, In what thou haſt ſaid, thou haſt not ſpoken truth; for there hath many been converted by our Preaching, and many godly people have we begotten, and the Lord hath given a bleſſing to our Labors; and by this we know we are the Lords Meſſengers to his people, and the true Laborers in his Vineyard.</p>
               <p>O my Friends, do not think in what I have ſaid, that I have any minde to detract from you what is your due, or to wrong any of you in the leaſt: For I confeſs, Like may beget like; for that is oft a truth in nature, and ſo in you. For I do not deny, but many of you have a form of godlineſs, and as you are in that form, you may beget others alſo into the ſame form, and ſo make them like your ſelves; and yet all of you without the power of God, and love of God, and wiſdom of God; For if the love of God were ſhed abroad in your hearts, it would turn your hearts into its own image; but as yet, you have not that love, and therefore you have hatred in your hearts, both againſt God and man: And from hence it is, That you can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſecute and deſtroy all that worſhip not God in your way;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118484:21"/>and this you have no order for, nor example, either from Chriſt, or any of his followers; but you and all your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts go not a jot further then the Scribes and Phariſees; but in that you believe Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and have an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical or Notional Faith of him in your head; but the world and ſelfneſs lyeth in your hearts, and you are as hide-bound to the Goſpel-forms, as the Scribes and Phariſees were to circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the formes under the Law; and as they being hide-bound or heart-bound to theſe forms, ſo became they to be the enemies of Chriſt, when he appeared in the fleſh. And the very ſame are you, and all your Converts faſt tied in your heart to the Goſpel-forms; and hereby you are become the enemies of Chriſt appearing in the ſpirits of men, and ſo are you become the perſecutors of Chriſt in the Saints; and yet in this you think you do God good ſervice: and the greateſt perfection in your Converts is, when they are made exceeding zealous for the honor and glory of God (as they ſay) ſo that whoſoever wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God in any other way then theirs, then are they ſure of perſecution by you or them, if it be within the compaſs of your power; and this you have in your generation, and that faith and love, and full aſſurance of your ſalvation, alwaies is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pretended zeal for the honor and glory of God; and from hence you count all other the enemies of God, who have not the ſame garb that you have. And all this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion you brag of, is nothing elſe but a converſion from evil to far worſe; for you have turned ſome of your Hearers from ſome outward groſſe offences, and have brought them into a conformity to duty as you call it, and by the refraining the outward groſsneſſe, and cloſing to, and with the outward duties your Conſcience beginneth to ceaſe biting ſo long as you walk obſequiouſly therein, and from hence the foule Feind tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes himſelfe into the Angel of Light, and ſecretly wraps himſelfe in your actings, and by his power when once gotten, rightly joyned to Selfe Righteouſneſſe, then hath he power to worke Wonders, and can worke like God, and give conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Soule, and bring it into raptures, and raviſhments, and can bring the Promiſes to remembrance, which is ſuitable to confirme his workings, and from ſuch working he can make the Soule beleeve its regeneration, and its calling, and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made ſure, and that with a witneſſe too; in which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118484:22"/>the Soule will oft rejoyce, and ſhall have many falſe flaſhes of Love, which the Soule can no way know, but it is the feeling of the love of God, and if you have brought any Soule thus far, as to this full aſſurance, and to be partakers of ſuch feeling, you thinke you have brought them farre on in grace; and thus farre I know you may bring a Soule by your Miniſtery, and yet this Soule is but two-fold the Childe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan more then it was before. I will make this plaine unto you; for when the Soule before was in the groſſe actings, then was that perſon in a more hopefull way for God to bring it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his owne way then it is now, for (then) when God would have brought theſe perſons from their ſinne, in his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them either by himſelfe, or by thoſe whom he would uſe for that worke; then I ſay there was hope theſe Soules might have been led in a way whereby they ſhould have eſcaped the ſnare of Satan.</p>
               <p>But being that theſe ſoules are in the ſnare, they are more in captivity to him then they were before, and the reaſon is, becauſe then God had ſome power in the Conſciences of them, and oft times condemned them for their outward groſsneſſe, but now they being brought out of theſe outward ſinnes, into the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of outward formes, their Conſcience loſeth that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and now inſtead thereof the Feind hath power to feed the Soule, as is aforeſaid, the which he had no power to doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in this condition the Soule is well pleaſed to be, and can ſtand for it ſelfe ſtoutly, that it is ſealed to God, and made ſure of Salvation, and ſo is become exceeding fool-hardy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in its fooles paradiſe, and being fed by falſe conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and herein that perſon is once more the childe of Satan then before.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, whereas before theſe ſoules were converted by you, they would not perſecute, or bring any to death for not walking in their waies; but now your Converts muſt ſeeke the honour of God, and ſo in zeale for his glory they muſt become perſecutors and deſtroyers of their fellow Creatures, becauſe they will not honour God in their way, and thus are they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Murderers, and yet they doe not know it; but the ſame ſpirit that ruleth in them muſt they of neceſſity bee obedient to, and it is proved before, that that ſpirit in them that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth is Satan, and he it is that ſetteth them on work. For as our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118484:22"/>Saviour ſaith, <hi>He was a murtherer from the beginning, and his works will you do,</hi> Joh. 8.44. And herein are your Converts twofold the children of Satan more then they were before. It was not the <hi>Publicans and ſinners</hi> that put Chriſt to death; no, no, it was the religious zealots under the Law, viz. holy <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> but you diſclaime from their righteouſneſſe, and their actings againſt Chriſt in their dayes, when he was in the fleſh amongſt them; and your hearts tell you, if Chriſt were now amongſt you, you would not doe ſo to him; was not the ſame thoughts in the Scribes and Phariſees? yea, and it ſeemes they ſaid, if they had lived in the dayes of their fore-fathers, they would not have killed the holy Prophets as they did, and yet they were never ſatisfied untill they had put Chriſt to death. Ah friends, take heed to your ſelves, for to this day that Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is alive, and ſhall be ſtill untill the time of their deſtruction, and this portion and lot hath light upon you in your Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in this blindneſſe you are, and can no more ſee your ſelves then they did; for as Chriſt in his appearing in the Fleſh was hid from them, ſo when he cometh in ſpirit he ſhall be as farre hid from you; for he ſhall ſo appeare in ſpirit that hee cannot be knowne of you, nor ſhall you ſee any thing in thoſe whom he is, that ſhall be acceptable to you; for you are too wiſe to know his way, and by your wiſdome you have taught him to others, and others by the curioſity of their eares have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him from you, and in this your doing you thinke you have him, but you are beguiled, for the way he manifeſteth himſelfe to his people you cannot know, neither the way to him can you know, and yet you ſay, <hi>you ſee, and feele, and know him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſinne remaineth,</hi> Joh. 9.41.</p>
               <p>And if you deſire to know any further of your ſelves, and of your peoples beſt converſion, turne back to your embleme before, and weigh it well, and ponder it ſeriouſly, for I aſſure you, that is your true picture both inward and outward; and this is all the worke you worke, to convert men from evill, bringing them to be worſe, and ſo by your meanes they are two-fold more the children of Satan then they were before. And you can no otherwiſe doe, for your calling into your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was of Satan, and the perfecting of the worke endeth in him; for if you had been ſent of God, you ſhould have turned his people from their ſin.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:118484:23"/>
               <p>But this you have not done, but kept them in their ſin, for even your beſt Converts of whom you make your boaſt, are but men in their ſinne, and that which you call ſinne, which you ſay you have turned them from, is but that which a civill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe doth loath, and is gotten by cuſtome, and may bee left off by cuſtome; and this may every Creature forſake, by vertue of the power in them by Creation, having no more but the common grace in them: and theſe things the Creature may forſake without your helpe, and theſe are not the greateſt ſinnes in men though they ſeeme ſo to you, becauſe you never ſaw greater in your owne hearts; and the great myſtery of ſin, and the abomination that maketh deſolation, and the Man of ſinne, that exalteth himſelfe above God, or any that is called by the name of God, and the great Antichriſt, or great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of Chriſt; theſe you never found out in your owne heart, much leſſe in other; nay you know not what they meane, nor where they have their being, but you beat your braines to finde them without you, and will draw concluſions that the Turk, and Pope, and Biſhops, and Independants, and Anabaptiſts, and other Sects, are the things the Scripture meaneth of. O fooles, and unwiſe, though you can ſteale into the Miniſtery by unlawfull wayes, yet can you not ſteale into Gods minde and ſecrets, nor once ſo much as have a looke into the myſterie of godlineſſe, and then be ſure you ſhall but little be acquainted what is the myſterie of ſinne, but you ſhall have no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hereof then cometh from the teaching of the God that brought you into the places where you are, and I am ſure hee will keep you farre enough from the knowledge of that myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for to this very day amongſt you all, I have not heard either by preaching, writing, or ſpeaking, that any of you ever could diſtinctly finde out the great myſterie of ſinne in the heart of man; but this hath God laid upon you as one of his greateſt Curſes, and the largeneſſe hereof covereth all your Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And if you had been ſent of God, you ſhould have known this, and ſhould have made the people know it alſo, and by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it they ſhould have had power to have overcome it, and then ſhould they have had the pure Language returned to them, <hi>Zep.</hi> 3.9. <hi>And they ſhould have ſpoken with new tongues,</hi> Act. 10.46. <hi>And they ſhould have reigned with the Lambe, and ſung out his praiſe,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118484:23"/>Revel.</hi> 14.3. but you have kept the people in great darkneſſe, and you have made dull their eares, and you have been the cauſe of the hardneſſe of their heart, and they to this day are partakers of the Curſe with you, for many of them cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the voyce of Chriſt when he ſpeaketh, becauſe they be ſo taught in your Language. O fooles, when will you forſake your fooliſhneſſe? O forſake it, and give over your deceiving of the people before your determined deſtruction fall upon you, for I aſſure you it is in coming, and woe wil be to you if it come upon you, and you be found in the places where you are.</p>
               <p>But I know you have waies enough to evade, and put off from you what I have ſaid, and to pluck my Arrow out of your hearts, and throw it from you; but I would not have you to doe ſo, but let it enter into you: for it will not deſtroy you, but be a meanes to purge you from your filthineſſe, and if you doe but make right uſe of it, you ſhall in time know that I ſhot at a right marke, for I would have you no longer deceived in your ſelves, but ſeeke to finde out your deceit; and when you have found it out, be not aſhamed to confeſſe what you have done, and in the very places where you have deceived the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there would I have you to declare how you have deceived them; think of what I have here ſaid unto you when you goe into your Pulpits, and thinke no ſhame to confeſs before all men what wickedneſſe you have committed. But I am afraid your pride and covetouſneſſe is ſo great that they will not let you do ſo; but it is no matter, for whether you wil or no, your ſins ſhall be laid open before the face of men and Angels: For I know that the God that brought you into your places, will go about to hold you in your places, let me, and an Angel from Heaven perſwade you to the contrary; for I know that you will rather go about to perſecute me, then to be warned by me; but for that I care not, for neceſſitie is upon me, and wo would it be to me, if I ſhould keep ſilence. I know alſo how many ways you will object againſt what I have written to you; but I warrant you I have an anſwer for every one of your objections, and I would have anſwered them all before I had left you, but that I know, if you will not lay this to heart, it had but been follie in me to write any more; for if I (as I make no doubt, but I very wel could) have ſtopped all your mouths in what you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118484:24"/>could object; yet I know your will is ſo bent in the way, that when you had nothing to ſay, you would ſtone me to death, if you durſt; for you are of the ſame generation, with whom <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> had to do, who was not able to reſiſt his ſpirit he ſpake with, yet they could ſtone him to death, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.58. For the truth is, that the God of your Fathers whom you worſhip, <hi>viz. Self-pride, ſelf-praiſe, ſelf-profit, ſelf-wiſdom, ſelf-power, ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> (Self) being the firſt perſon in the Trinity, who by his ſpirit of wiſdom doth ſo inſpire you; and in obedience to the ſame, you become always reſiſters of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51.</p>
               <p>But being paſt hopes of doing good to the generality of you, becauſe I know your blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, at preſent I will adde no more to what I have ſaid, for to you who are ſealed up for deſtruction, here is too much; but if happily there be ſome amongſt you, who are not ſealed and ſetled in blindneſs, having ſome want and emptineſs in their ſouls, and the ſame lying upon their ſpirits in making them to finde little but eaſe, comfort, or content, in any thing they either act or ſpeak, and that can finde nothing but wo and ſorrow, in all they go about, either in the world or their forms of Religion: I ſay, if there be any ſuch ſouls amongſt you, I know they have that within them, that will cauſe them to cloſe with what I here have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; and confeſs, that I have ſaid nothing but that which is as true as truth it ſelf: And to ſuch ſouls, this I know will be uſeful, for one reproof enters more into a wiſeman, then a hundred ſtripes doth into a fool, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.10. But for all other before-ſaid, they are but fools, and will not believe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I leave them to be deſtroyed by their own folly, and will return to the poor deluded people under them, and give them a friendly advice, and ſhew them how they have been cheated and couſened by theſe foul Beaſts, whom the Devil hath moſt ſubtilly brought into the Miniſtery, and have reigned by his means ſo many hundred years, whereby the true knowledge of God is worn out from amongſt the ſons of men, and all under a form of faith in Chriſt, and a brain-knowledge of God, and performing ſome duties which they tell you is holy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have they ſtrangled your ſouls, and made you believe you were in the ways of God, when alas, you were but in your own ways, and the way of God, as yet, you never knew.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:118484:24"/>
               <p>Then hearken O ye poor deluded ſouls, who have a deſire to know your own deceit, and have a willingneſs in you to know what the way of God is; and where this God is, and where the way to meet with your God is; and ſee and know that your ways you have lived in, and rejoyced in, how they are but poor, weak, beggerly things, and ſo long as you live in them, you live but in your ſelf; and as long as you live in them, you are not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven, neither to know the Myſteries of God, nor the miſery of the ſin that is in you, and without you know that, you ſhall not know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>As I have ſhewed you the original of the Miniſters, from whence they came, ſo I will ſhew you your Religion, and your duties and obſervations from whence they came; and upon what grounds your forms are pitched, and what is all that you can reap out of the very beſt of your forms; and how far you may act in your forms, and yet have your ſpirits deprived of the love of God, which is the ſalvation of all ſouls that are ſaved; and I will ſhew you from what principles your perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ariſe, and by what power they are performed.</p>
               <p>And firſt for your Religion, I finde it to be nothing elſe but a feigned fantaſtick thing, raiſed up, by, and through the vain conceits of your blinde Miniſters, who have no grounds for what they affirm, but onely falſe concluſions which they draw from true principles in others; and likewiſe, the beſt grounds they have for any thing contained in the profeſſion, it is no more but examples from others, who had command to obſerve ſuch things, and know the minde of him who commanded theſe things, and obſerved theſe things according to the minde, and intent of him, who gave them command to obſerve ſuch things; but your Miniſters being ignorant of the minde of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, obſerve the ſame by example, not knowing the minde of the Commander; and therefore, they have given out theſe things to you, and their own minde in them; and from them have you obſerved theſe things in your Religion. But now I will come to ſome particulars, and I wiſh you to obſerve well what is delivered unto you by my Pen, and the Lord give you hearts to underſtand the truth I ſhall deliver to you.</p>
               <p>And firſt I come to that which is a principal point, and part
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118484:25"/>of your Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The obſervation of the Sabbath, as you call it; but that is not a proper name for it, except you profeſs Circumciſion, and ſo become one with the Jews; for to them was this delivered amongſt the other Commandments, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted at the beginning; and when God had given out the reſt of the Commandments to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he repeateth over this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of keeping the Sabbath, and telleth <hi>Moſes</hi> for what end and purpoſe he had given that charge of keeping it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhould be a ſign between him, and the people, that they might know who ſanctified them; and whoſoever did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from all manner of work upon that day, was to be put to death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this was to be a ſign between God and them in all their Generations.</p>
               <p>Now if it were delivered to the Jews as a ſign, then was there ſomething ſignified in it, and appointed out by it to them. I will tell you what it held out to them, it held out three things in its ſignification. As for the firſt, it was the righteouſneſs of God, by which he ſanctified them, without any thing in them, or by them whatſoever; and as they were to ceaſe from all labor whatſoever on pain of death, ſo were they not to look at any thing within themſelves whatſoever, whereby they ſhould look to be made holy; for if they did, it was the very death of their ſouls, and God knew it well, that they would be looking at ſomething in themſelves, and would ſecretly be oblieging him to it; and <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them a caveat of the ſame, when he bad them take heed to themſelves, leaſt they ſhould ſay in their hearts for my righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hath the Lord done theſe things for me, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.9. And for this very thing the Sabbath was to be a ſign of his ſanctifying them, and that ſanctification was not of themſelves, but that they were as clean ſtript of all righteouſneſs to ſanctifie themſelves, as he gave out ſtrict command to ceaſe from all labor whatſoever; and that they ſhould always be looking out of themſelves unto the Lord their God, who ſanctified them; and that they ſhould know that ſanctification was of him, he did very oft rehearſe the ſame to them, as may be ſeen, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.9, 16. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.28. and many other places. And as it was given them for a ſign of the ſanctification of God, ſo it ſignified a ſpiritual reſt unto them, which reſt ſhould be in God; that as their bodies was refreſhed, in and by that reſt, ſo ſhould their ſpirits be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118484:25"/>in him, and be at reſt, when they had laid aſide, and caſt off all toyl and labor of ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> Caring, fearing, loving, and deſiring to be ſatisfied with created things, and that they were brought out of, and beyond all their ſecret dependancy of what they acted or obſerved; which while they lived in, they were the cauſe why all toyl and labor hapned to their ſpirits, in which they were deprived of the ſweet reſt in God: For when the heart of man is carried out from the reſt in God, then is it in toyl about ſome created thing, and whatſoever it be, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth nothing but reſtleſsneſs; and this made <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, who had tryed all things, and found that thoſe who would ſeek reſt in any thing created, ſhould be deceived; and that he ſhould finde nothing <hi>but ſorrow and grief, yea, his heart taketh not reſt in the night, Eccleſ.</hi> 2.23. And becauſe the Lord knew the people would be ſeeking reſt in other things, therefore he gave them this ſign of the Sabbath, wherein they ſhould know from whom the reſt of their ſpirits ſhould come: And when they were gone out from him, and had not kept the Sabbath which held out to them the reſt of their ſouls, but were turned from him; yet he would have them to return again to him, and ask and enquire for the way that they had left; and in walking therein, they <hi>ſhould finde reſt for their ſouls, Jer.</hi> 6.16. And <hi>David</hi> knew full well what was the reſt of ſpirit, and ſaid to himſelf, <hi>O my ſoul return to thy reſt, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 116.7.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, This Sabbath was a ſign of the eternal reſt that ſouls ſhould have in him, after the end of ſo many ſeveral or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and diſpenſations, both inwardly and outwardly, theſe being darkly held out to them by the number of ſix days, and the ſeventh to be the day of reſt, and kept holy to the Lord: And that order of numbering ſix days, was by the Lords own example held out to them in the firſt Creation, where it is ſaid, the Lord was ſix days in working, and creating all things, though God himſelf wrought not in that manner, but to ſtoop to our weak underſtanding of him; that in our weak know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge could apprehend nothing at all of him, if he were not pleaſed to let out himſelf in ways whereby we might darkly grope after him: And ſo in theſe ſeveral out-lettings of himſelf in theſe weak ways, we might be brought by little and little paſſing through theſe diſpenſations, that we thereby might be made fit and able to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118484:26"/>of perſecution, wherein we ſhould be in a capabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to behold, and ſtand in the preſence and right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God himſelfe. And becauſe to ſpeake of theſe ſeven fold diſpenſations is not ſuitable for you at preſent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ignorance of the times as yet; elſe, it may bee you ſhould have heard them more clearly defined to you, for I aſſure you, there is a Myſtery in theſe numbers, which as yet the moſt of the Sons of men be ignorant of, and the Myſtery in them was wrapt in them in the beginning, and was myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally holden out to the Sons of men by <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> by the ſeven Seales, the ſeven Angels who ſounded the ſeven Trumpets, and the pouring out of the ſeven Viols, which no man can, or ever ſhall underſtand, untill he be brought to live in the heart of God, and God to live in his heart, for none elſe is fit to know his ſecrets.</p>
               <p>And under theſe three conſiderations it was, that God gave out ſo ſtrict command for the obſervation of the ſeventh day, or Sabbath, and under theſe conſiderations was Chriſt held out to them in his properties of Sanctification, and ſpiritual reſt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal reſt of Souls, and in this reſpect he was Lord over the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as himſelf teſtifieth in <hi>Mark</hi> 2.28. And as the Leviticall or Ceremoniall Law held out, or were the ſhadows of the Office of Chriſt, both of ſuffering and ſacrifice, which all of them was to be excluded after his death; ſo was the Sabbath to be excluded when the thing ſignified by it was come, and till that time that commandement was in force; but when Chriſt was come, you may obſerve how oft himſelf did croſſe the Scribes and Phariſees, in not obſerving the Sabbath according to their order, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.23.</p>
               <p>And when our Saviour upon divers occaſions was to ſpeake of the Lawes of Commandement which was to ſtand in force, and ſhould not in any wiſe paſſe away till they were fulfilled, as may be ſeen in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. &amp;c. yet never did he ſo much as touch or give command to keep the Sabbath, becauſe hee knew the ſame was fulfilled in his appearing, of which he was Lord; and whoſoever doth obſerve the ſeventh day upon the obedience of the Commands, before the appearance of Chriſt in the Fleſh: they erre, not knowing the minde of God in his Commands, and ſo they are blinded from beholding Chriſt in his properties therein contained, and ſo by, and in the obſervation of that day they become that to themſelves which of right doth belong to Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:118484:26"/>
               <p>But I know you will ſay, you doe not obſerve that day up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame account as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did, but under a Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, having the ſame day changed unto another day, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt day, in which Chriſt roſe from the dead, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we call it not a Sabbath, but the Lords Day.</p>
               <p>It is true, you call it the Lords Day, but for that you have neither command nor example in all the New Teſtament, but only as you may infer from that ſaying of St. <hi>John,</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. the which you cannot juſtly affirme, that it was the firſt day of the week in which Chriſt roſe from the Dead; but I would have you to know what the Lords Day is, and how <hi>John</hi> called that day the Lords Day; though every day be the Lords, yet he hath two dayes which he more uſually claimeth for his owne, as we may ſee in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> a day of his executing his anger againſt ſin, and man for ſin, and this is called the Day of the Lord, as you may ſee in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.12. &amp; 13.6.9. &amp; 34 8. <hi>Ier.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.22, &amp;c. and another day he hath, wherein he will ſhew to man the Myſteries of his Kingdom, and the favour of his loving kindneſſe, in which day the Souls of his people ſhal be glad, and rejoyce, and this is the Lords Day, wherein he will be glorified and magnified in the ſouls of his people, when they are made to ſee, and know his wonderfull loving kindneſs manifeſted in their ſoules, and that his Sonne Jeſus only ruleth and reigneth above all Power and Principalities: and this day you may ſee ſet out in many places of Scripture alſo; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. &amp; 26.1. &amp; 28.5. &amp; 29.18, &amp;c. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. and in this Day of the Lord was <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Spirit, where was made knowne to him theſe great Myſteries. And well might he call it the Lords Day, for ſo it was, but from thence none can juſtly gather that this day you obſerve can be called the Lords Day more then any other, and in ſo doing you follow but traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, having no command for it in all the Scripture; therefore take heed you make not the Commandements of God of none effect by your tradition; for this was the doing of the Scribes and Phariſees by which they were blinded, and could not know Chriſt to be the Son of God, when he was amongſt them in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>But in calling it the firſt day, it may be ſaid that is the moſt proper name of it, becauſe of ſome grounds in Scripture for ſo doing, but yet you have no evidence, nor command in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118484:27"/>all the New Teſtament, for obſerving the firſt day after the manner of the Sabbath, only you have ſome examples in the Primitive time for ſome things occaſionally which were done upon it, as one time the Diſciples were gathered together to breake Bread, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. and all that the Apoſtle gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to them to obſerve upon that day was, to make a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction amongſt them for the poore Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. for no other thing to be obſerved upon that day have you any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and this command I doubt you doe not obey upon that day, for your fooliſh holineſſe hath eaten out your charity, which you ſhould have ſhewed upon that day. And this was an invention of your wiſe preaching Miniſters, who changed the worke of that day into a ſubmiſſive hearing of them ſpeake ſo long upon that day, and for this they have neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor example from, or in the Primitive inſtitutions, but from the time of Superſtition, in which time their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers tooke away the worke of that day, and erected a greater holineſſe upon that day, then to make collections for the poor; and thus you have obſerved what they invented, and yet you cannot ſee wherein you are blinded.</p>
               <p>But you may object, that in what I have ſaid, I ſeem to make voyd the Sabbath, or Lords day, or firſt day.</p>
               <p>It is true, I make the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath voyd, and likewiſe the name of this day to be the Lords Day more then any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have no command for them in the time of the Goſpel; but as for the firſt day I allow of it, in eaſe it be obſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to example, and command in the time of the Goſpel, and Primitive inſtitutions, but no further may any man allow of it, in making the obſervation of it like to the Sabbath of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and ſo place it as a principle in their religion; this I deny, and that upon better grounds then you have for making it what it is not; but if you will obſerve this day, I would have you to ſet it in its right place, leaſt in your good thinking you give that to the day, and your duties obſerved upon that day, which doth of right belong to Chriſt, and in ſo doing that day becometh Lord over you, whereas thoſe who are in Chriſt are Lords over that day: And in obſerving of that day I would have you to obſerve it as by tradition, and not by command; and likewiſe in reſpect of the obedience to the higher Powers, who would have ſuch a day obſerved for ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118484:27"/>pious end: and in theſe reſpects I could wiſh, that not only the firſt day of every weeke, but the fourth alſo were ſet apart for pious ends, but not to make them principles in Religion. But herein is the weakneſſe and ignorance of men made manifeſt, for whatſoever hath been inſtituted by men in the time of their purity, and for pious ends, and was good ſo long as they were uſed, and obſerved for no other end then they were aimed for; but not long could any inſtitution ſtand, untill the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of men through their good thinking made more of theſe things, then ever they were intended for, and ſo the ſame became to be made either a god, or a principle in mens religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then the ſame did more hurt then good, to thoſe who were the obſervers of ſuch things, becauſe of their too much Idolizing of theſe inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe I know it to be good to reſt one day in ſeven, if it were but to croſſe the cruelty and oppreſſion of Mankind, whoſe Luſt is ſo great that he would too much wrong his fellow Creatures, by keeping them at too hard, and too long labour, as many Maſters would their Servants, yea, their poore Horſe and Ox, yea and their owne bodies too.</p>
               <p>And whoſo goeth about to obſerve that day upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration then what is before ſaid, doth erre in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is nothing elſe but being beguiled, by the precepts of the Prieſts, in which they erre themſelves, and cauſe all other to goe aſtray who are led by them, and ſo the blinde leadeth the blinde till both fall into the ditch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.14. I might have ſaid much more upon this ſubject, but what is ſaid may ſerve to make appeare, that the obſervation of a day without any command, for it cannot be a principle in Religion, as blinde ignorance hath ſtated it; but letting it paſſe, I come to a ſecond principle in your Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, but that Sacrament is not a proper name for it, for it is but a ſuperſtitious epithite, and there is no ſuch name for it in all the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Indeed for this you have a command by our Saviour, it being his owne inſtitution, and ſome examples alſo in the Primitive time for what you doe herein; but yet I would have you to know, that you have neither command, nor example for what you affirme of the breaking of Bread, or otherwiſe called the Lords Supper: for you affirm, that in the receiving of Bread
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118484:28"/>and Wine, that in that act you have your faith confirmed and ſtrengthened; thus you have wreſted the command of Chriſt herein to the end he never aymed it for, for in this your doing you differ not from the Papiſts themſelves in the ſubſtance of this thing, only you differ in the circumſtances and that is all: for they pretend they eate the Body and Bloud of Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, and by ſo doing they ſay they live in Chriſt, and he liveth in them thereby; and you ſay in this you eate him Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and by ſo doing you live in him, and he in you; and that you have your faith much confirmed to you in this your act. O poore blinded fooles, you are herein miſled by your blinde Prieſts, for this is but one of their owne precepts, by which they have undone you, for they have played the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebankes with you herein, and have made you beleeve lyes for truth, for this your act doth not at all confirme your faith in caſe you have faith, but I will tell you true what you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, <hi>viz.</hi> conceit, or fancy, and no more, I ſhall prove it true, whether you will beleeve me or no; for there is nothing that doth confirme faith but that ſame that giveth faith; but no act of the Creature giveth, or createth faith, or maketh faith to grow in the heart of any man, and the giving and receiving of Bread and Wine is but an act of the Creature which is within the compaſſe of its owne power to doe, or not to doe; this I thinke you will confeſſe; and if this act had that vertue in it to give faith, who would want faith? but I thinke you are not yet ſo farre blinde as to ſay plainly, that faith is given to any by vertue of this act, but yet you may as well ſay, that faith is given thereby, as ſay that faith is confirmed thereby; for the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, and confirming of faith is both from one and the ſame fountaine, and God himſelfe is the Giver of faith, as you may ſee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. then if God be the Giver of faith, he is alſo the confirmer of it, without the acts of the Creature; and this truth the Apoſtle affirmeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and thanketh God on their behalfe for the graces given them of him, whereby the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt was confirmed in them, and that they waited for a further manifeſtation of Chriſt, who ſhould confirme them, to the end that they might be kept blameleſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. and as God in, and by his Son Jeſus is both the giver, and confirmer of faith; ſo by him he alwayes upholdeth the ſoule in faith, whenſoever it hath need of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118484:28"/>of the ſame; for he is both the beginning, and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith, yea, <hi>the author and finiſher of faith, Heb.</hi> 12.2. And this the Diſciples knew when they ſaid, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith, Luke</hi> 17.5. And it was Chriſt himſelf that ſtrengthned <hi>Peters</hi> faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. By all which, you may ſee plainly, that the receiving of Bread and Wine, is not faith confirmed, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or compleated; for you are but in blindneſs, in this your affirmation.</p>
               <p>But I would have you to know wherein you are blinded, if perhaps you might hereafter grope after the truth: For though this your act be a command of Chriſt himſelf, yet I would have you to know the minde of the Commander in the putting out of the command, for he put not out this command, thereby to detract from him, what did belong to himſelf; and in this you affirm, you detract from him, and give that to the acting in the command, and herein you tranſgreſs.</p>
               <p>But to tell you the minde of Chriſt in this command, I would have you to take notice of his own words, and let them not be wreſted by your wit, and you ſhall know that he gave out this command for no other thing, but for a help of the weak memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of men, who are very ſubject to forget the love of their deareſt friends in a little time, after they be departed from them: yea, your own experience will tell you the truth of this, that after the death and departure of your deareſt friends, how that a very ſhort time will wear the thoughts of them out of your memory. And ſo ſome dear loving friend at his death will leave a Ring, or ſome other token of love to his beloved friend or friends, and bid him remember him when he looketh upon the ſame; the which beholding, doth raiſe or renew freſh thoughts of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend, and ſo becometh the weak forgetful memory to be ſtrengthned.</p>
               <p>Even for this very end did Chriſt leave his Diſciples that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that in the obſerving of the ſame, they ſhould keep him (their dear loving Maſter) ſtill in their memory, and think of him when his bodily preſence was taken from them, and that they in the remembring of him ſhould think of his example of life, and walk accordingly in all his other commands, the which he had enjoyned them; and in the keeping of theſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they ſhould be known to be his Diſciples, and ſhould live in him, and he in them; and that they ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118484:29"/>with him, and the Father; and likewiſe he tells them, how the world would hate and perſecute them, and kill them, with many other exhortations to them, and commands given them before his departure, after he had left them this love-token of remembrance, as you may ſee in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. For Jeſus knew, after he was gone from them, that they ſhould have many temptations and tryals, whereby they ſhould be much troubled, and therefore he would have them to keep him ſtill in memory; for if ſuch things were done to the green Tree, what would be done to the dry Trees, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.31. But yet I know you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſay, that there is ſomething more included in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand becauſe of the act, and the other words ſpoken by Chriſt, when he gave out this command.</p>
               <p>It is true, for as in the time of the Law there was in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, things killed and offered, which was Types of the firſt appearance of Chriſt in the Humane nature, and the life of Chriſt in the Humane nature, and the death of Chriſt in the Humane nature, and the Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in this act of Chriſt there is a Type alſo, in which there is ſomething typified.</p>
               <p>In which Type there is theſe things to be obſerved. Firſt, The time. Secondly, The matter. Thirdly, The manner: And fourthly, The end.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the time, It was at the very ſame time of the Jews Paſſoever, which was to be kept in their generation, until the death of Chriſt; which Paſſoever was inſtituted before the death of the firſt-born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and this was the preſervation of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from that death; ſo that where the blood of the Paſcal Lamb was on the poſts of the door, there the deſtroyer had no power; and by the ſlaying of the firſt-born in <hi>Egypt, Pharaoh</hi> and his people was conſtrained to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. And this Paſſover was kept of the Jews for a memorial of what was done; and at the very time of the Jews keeping this Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was, that Jeſus inſtituted this Type, which Type holdeth out a more clear beholding of himſelf to the world, then the other Type of the Paſſover did; for that Type of the Jews Paſſover was but as a ſhadow, whereby to know the ſubſtance; and a ſhadow is but a dark repreſentation of a thing, and ſo this dark ſhadow was to be done away; that the Image is a clearer repreſentation of the ſubſtance, then the ſhadow; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118484:29"/>yet both the ſhadow, and the image, are but repreſentations of the ſubſtance, the one more clearer then the other; the darker done away, and the clearer eſtabliſhed. And this was one reaſon why Chriſt inſtituted this Type or Image at that time, that after he was departed, the ſons of men might have a more clear ſight of him after his appearing in the fleſh, then they had before; for then they lived under the ſhadow, or dark repreſentation, but now under the Goſpel we have the Image or clearer repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, as you may ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, at the time of the inſtitution of this Paſſover, God had a marvellous work to do, <hi>viz.</hi> To bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> from under the bondage of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſo at this very time of Chriſts inſtituting of this Type, God had a wondrous work to do, <hi>viz.</hi> To bring the ſouls of believers out of the captivity of the Devil, Sin, Death, and Hell; for after the death of the Paſchal Lamb, the firſt-born of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſlain; and ſo their proud hearts were made to ſtoop.</p>
               <p>So by the death of Chriſt, the firſt-born of the Devil, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin was deſtroyed, and Death and Hell conquered, and ſo a way was made for all ſouls to come out of their captivity; for ſin is the firſt-born childe of the devil, his beloved, and his power and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>For this is a truth in nature, that the firſt-born is the ſtrength, and power, and dignity of the Parents, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith to <hi>Reuben</hi> his firſt-born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.3. So ſin being the firſt-born childe of the devil, therein conſiſteth his power and ſtrength, and when this is ſlain, then is he overcome; and ſo death being the childe of ſin, loſeth his power; for as ſin is the firſt-born of the devil, ſo death is the firſt-born of ſin, for death is brought out by ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. And as death is the firſt born of ſin, ſo Hell is the firſt-born of death, and alway follows its father, <hi>Revel.</hi> So all theſe firſt-born were to be deſtroyed by another firſt born, and that was Jeſus the firſt-born of God, a Type of whom we have in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law by the firſt-born of all things, which ſhould be called holy to the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.13. And as this firſt born Son, or Lamb of God, overcame the Devil, Sin, Death, and Hell, by himſelf, ſo that they had no power over him; ſo by the ſame power he overcometh all theſe, for thoſe who are the true followers of him in his life and example, obeying his commands,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118484:30"/>and taking up his croſs and bearing it to the very death, thoſe ſhall know the power and vertue of his life, death, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and ſhall live with him in the union of the Father; and when he inſtituted this Type, he would have them to remember this, whenſoever they would do the like.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, as the firſt-born of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſlain, ſo on the contrary the poeple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſaved from the power of the deſtroyer, by the efficacy of the blood of the Paſchal Lamb, where it was ſprinkled upon the two ſide poſts, and the lintel of the gate, <hi>viz.</hi> The Will, the Underſtanding, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the Noble Faculties of the ſoul; for as the two poſts, and the lintel do differ in their property, yet in cloſe joyning together they make but one, ſo in their properties they may be diſtinguiſhed, but in unity they are not diſtinguiſhable. And theſe three in their diſtinct properties being ſprinkled by the blood of the Lamb, the deſtroyer, <hi>viz.</hi> the juſtice of God can have no power to enter, to deſtroy any of the Inhabitants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the habitation of that minde, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, Hope, and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In caſe that none of the Inhabitants went out of door beyond the ſprinkled poſt: and to the very ſame purpoſe our Saviour gave command to abide in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15 4. for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the ſafety of the ſoul with all its affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this blood of the Lamb being ſprinkled upon the poſts as before ſaid, is the mark or ſign of Gods ſanctification, or ſetting that ſoul apart in the more noble parts, until he have executed juſtice of, and upon the world, fleſh, and devil, death, ſin, and hell, who have their habitation in the inferior parts of the ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſuality, and the reaſon, and imagination, which by their great power have kept the inhabitants of the noble part in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>But to illuſtrate a little more the ſprinkling of the two ſide poſts, and the lintel, in their threefold property, I will ſhew you how the Scripture in other places pointeth at them, and firſt for the property of the one poſt, and its ſprinkling, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Firſt for its property; As the one poſt of the gate having hinges, whereupon the one leaf of the gate is hung ſo, that thereby it hath the glibneſs to open and ſhut; ſo the Conſcience hath two hinges, <hi>viz.</hi> the outward teachings, and the inward dictates of God, upon which the one leaf of the gate hangeth,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118484:30"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the fear of God. And the underſtanding as the other poſt, hath other two hinges, on which the other leaf hangeth; and theſe two hinges is true wiſdom, and right knowledge, upon which the other leaf hangeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the pure deſire of God; and theſe two leaves being cloſe ſhut, and ſafely kept together, the adverſary hath leſs power to enter. But theſe two poſts are not fit for the bearing of the two leaves of the gate, until the lintel couple them together. So neither the Conſcience, nor the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, can be ſuitable for carrying the fear and deſire of God, in their right order, until the will with its property, yeilding obedience in its ghoſtly acting, bee conjoyned to both; and ſo when all their threefold properties meet in union, then are the two leaves of the gate hung in right order.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the ſprinkling of the firſt ſide poſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſcience. As for Conſcience before it be ſprinkled with the blood of the Lamb, it is but the leader of men into error, as well as into truth, as may be ſeen in the Apoſtle, who, by, and through the leading thereof, perſecuted the Saints. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Scribes and Phariſees, that put Chriſt to death; and though man have never ſo much zeal for God, yet his conſcience not ſtruck or ſprinkled, all his works is but ſin, and dead works, and this made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> write the ſame truth, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. And while any mans heart or will yeeldeth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch a conſcience, all his obedience is evil, becauſe his conſcience is evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. And ſo long as man findeth any life in theſe conſcientious walkings, he hath but beſprinkled his conſcience with the blood of Bulls and Goats, and his own mark is upon the poſt, and ſaveth himſelf from the deſtroyer, as he thinketh. But the conſcience being ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus, then doth man truly know himſelf to be a ſinner, and by that blood, his peace and ſafety is to be procured, and full wel knoweth that all his good actings are as bad as his evil act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And from hence it cometh to paſs, that ſin becometh to be out of meaſure ſinful; and by this means, all the bloody offerings, and ſprinkling of his own conſcience becometh to be rubbed off, and blotted out; and then the blood of the Lamb becomes to be ſprinkled upon the conſcience, whereby the ſame hath no power to condemn. This made the Apoſtle ſay, there was no condemnation to thoſe that were in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:118484:31"/>
               <p>Secondly, the underſtanding as holden out by the other ſide poſt (before it be ſprinkled with the bloud of the Lamb) is but darke in the conceiving of truth, and in its darkneſſe, mans Conſcience cannot give out right commands to the heart or will, for the right command of the Conſcience proceedeth from the pureneſſe of the underſtanding, and the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being darke, how great is that darkneſſe? <hi>Luke</hi> 11.35. and while man walketh in this darkneſſe he is deceived himſelfe, and deceiveth others alſo; his condition being nothing elſe but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and being deceived, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. yea ſtumbleth and falleth, and knoweth not whereupon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>But when man once knoweth his darkneſſe, then doth he cry after wiſdome, and knowledge, and ſeeketh them more then ſilver; and then it is that the Lord ſendeth his Angel to ſeale, or ſet a marke on the forehead of ſuch a ſoule before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angels worke their worke, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.2. <hi>viz.</hi> To give man the right knowledg and underſtanding of the great Myſtery both of ſinne, and godlineſſe, and by that the deſtroyer is kept out, for then he is that wiſe man that fore-ſeeth the evill and hideth himſelfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.23. and when the eyes of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are opened, the ſoul is ſealed with the character of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all this is by the bloud of the Lamb, which is that eye-ſalve ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.18. and where the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is thus marked, then the ſoule can truly ſee Chriſt, and cloſe with him in the propitiation of his Blood, but not before. But the ſprinkling of the lintel which holdeth out the heart, or will, is that which keepeth all together, and maketh the ſafety compleat, for it is the ſealing of the heart by the Blood of the Lamb that bringeth the ſoule into the union of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then is it with all the affection kept in under the wings of the Almighty, and then is the Blood of the Lambe rightly ſprinkled upon the intellectuall powers of the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſcience, underſtanding, and the will, and fitly framed; and being ſo marked with the ſprinkles of the Blood, the deſtroyer paſſeth over, and the ſprinkling of the Blood in this manner doth bring us out of all danger of ghoſtly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo that our ſoules paſſe ſafely out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from the bondage of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and over the red Sea through the Wilderneſſe into the Land of reſt; and this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle affirmeth, where he ſaith, <hi>We are not come to Mount Sina,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118484:31"/>&amp;c. but we are come to the Mount Sion, &amp;c. And to Jeſus the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Teſtament, and to the bloud of ſprinkling that ſpeaketh better things for us then the blood of</hi> Abel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And of this our Saviour made a promiſe to his Diſciples, that they ſhould live in the union of him and the Father, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.24. And the truth of this Promiſe they were all partakers of, for having their underſtanding ſprinkled, marked, clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or made pure by the Blood of the Lamb, thereby they were made able to ſee and underſtand the truth as it was in Jeſus; and by the cleare viſion of that Light their Conſciences being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ſame Blood, did beare witneſſe to the truth of that Light, and their hearts being ſprinkled by the ſame Blood, it was freed from the power of Sin, and Death, and errours of an evill Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 22. and did enjoy the vertue of that Light, ſo that the love of God was ſhed abroad in their hearts, whereby they were made able to love one another; and thus it was they became freed from ſinne both in the underſtanding, in the Conſcience, and in the will, and this made the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay, that <hi>the blood of Ieſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſinne,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. And when our Saviour inſtituted this Type, hee would have them to remember, and not to forget what was to be fulfilled in them, by the power and efficacy of his Blood: but I feare your underſtanding is too weak to conceive any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explaining of the Myſtery of the ſecond Type inſtituted by Chriſt, elſe I would have proceeded further in laying open more in this particular, therefore I give you but theſe ſhort touches and glimpſes, that thereby you may ſomewhat grope after the great Myſtery herein contained.</p>
               <p>So I will proceed, and give you ſome glimpſe of the manner of the preparation of the Paſſeover, in its ſignification, for the Paſchall Lamb was not to be eaten raw, nor to be ſodden in water, but to be roaſted with fire, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.9. Now I would have you to underſtand the Myſtery in water upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and why the Lamb was not to be ſodden therein.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Water in its ſignification here pointeth out the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of Sin and Luſt, which compaſſeth about the Soule, and by the out-breaking of its flouds the Soule becometh in danger of drowning: and <hi>David</hi> knew this, when he prayed to God to deliver him out of the deep waters, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69.14, 15.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, water is unſtable, which ſignifieth the unconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118484:32"/>of man in Nature, and how ſubject to waver, and turne from one ſinne to another, and how eaſily to be drawne to all iniquity, and this made <hi>Iacob</hi> uſe theſe words to <hi>Reuben, unſtable as water, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 49.4.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe water is but weake, yet of a deſtroying nature when man is over-head in it, for there is no hold to be taken of it whereby man can ſave himſelfe; ſo is ſinne a weake deliverer when the ſoule is in the depth of it, for there is no hold to bee taken by it, whereby the ſoule can ſave it ſelfe, but rather to be drowned in the depth thereof.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe whatſoever is ſodden in water it looſeth part of the vertue thereof, for the water draweth part of the vertue into its ſelfe. Under theſe conſiderations the Lambe was not to be ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in water, which points out in the Spirituall ſignification, that while man is in his naturall corruption, and while luſt, and love of the world, and unſtableneſſe of ſpirit, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to and fro by the power of ſinne inward or outward, and ſo cometh to owne Chriſt in his propitiation by way of an Hiſtoricall beleeving, this is to prepare the Paſchall Lambe to themſelves, contrary to the command of God, and doth boyle the ſame in water, viz. their ſin and luſts, by the fire of the falſe faith, and thereby their ſin, as the water, taketh the vertue of the Lamb into it ſelfe, and thus the broth is made ſweeter to them then the meat boyled in it; and from hence it is that ſinne is ſo pleaſant to men, becauſe they have ſeaſoned it by the vertue of the boyling of the Paſchall Lamb in it, <hi>viz.</hi> by the falſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the death of Chriſt, whereby they get to themſelves liberty to ſinne, and by ſo doing make Chriſt the author of unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.7. and can freely ſinne that grace may abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1.</p>
               <p>So as the Lamb was not to be ſodden in water, it was not to be eaten raw, for that was unſuitable to the digeſtion, and would indanger and damnifie the bodies, by bringing ſeverall caſualties upon it. And likewiſe, raw fleſh was counted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, and ſo when the plague of Leproſie was upon any ſo long as any raw fleſh was to be ſeen, that perſon was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted uncleane, but when the raw fleſh was wholly covered by the Leproſie, then that perſon was to be pronounced whole, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.12, 13. all which holdeth out to us in the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thoſe who looke upon Chriſt in the fleſh, as he was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118484:32"/>borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> lived in the Body, ſuffered in the Body, and roſe in the Body, and ſo becometh to be a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of God in any outward forme, and goeth no further; but to apply themſelves in theſe formes what Chriſt was in the fleſh, even this is to eate the Paſchall Lambe raw, and ſo bringeth diſtempers upon the ſoule, whereby it will be in danger of death, and theſe diſtempers are ſuch as looſen the ſtrength of the reines, whereby it becometh to have an iſſue of blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually running, <hi>viz.</hi> The thoughts, inclinations, feares, cares, loves, and deſires, running continually into the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet can worſhip God in a forme, and apply Chriſt in theſe formes, according as he was, and what he ſuffered in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>And from hence it is, that though they have the Plague of Leproſie upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> hearts full of ſin and ſelfeneſſe, yet doe they not know it, but by the Phyſick got out of theſe forms, they keep downe that Leproſie from their owne beholding, thinking to cure the ſame, and by ſo doing there is ſome raw fleſh ſtill in the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome good, ſome righteouſneſſe, ſome good conceit of what is acted in their holy forme, out of which there is many good thinkings raiſed in the minde, of the love of God, and faith in Chriſt, and ſanctification of the Spirit, &amp;c. all which is but as the raw fleſh ariſing amongſt the Leproſie; and while that ſoule hath that raw fleſh in it, it is but loathly in the eyes of God, and is accounted as uncleane; and untill man truly know himſelfe all over-ſpread by this plague of Leproſie, <hi>viz.</hi> ſin and ſelfneſſe as well in his good actings as in his evill actings, he is not in a capacity to be pronounced cleane, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knew the plague of this Leproſie well enough when he cryed out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 7.24. And for the pronouncing of ſuch cleane as are over-ſpread with this Leproſie of ſin, Chriſt came, and to ſave thoſe that knew themſelves inveſted therein from head to foot, inſide and outſide, and that bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thereof continually, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. And when our Saviour inſtituted this Type, this hee included in the ſame remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>Now the manner of the preparation of the Paſchall Lambe was to be roſted with Fire, Fire having in it theſe ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> wrath, anger, fury, heat, conſuming, terribleneſs, &amp;c.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118484:33"/>and in its better ſignification it holds out good, <hi>viz.</hi> comfort, light, and love, and zeale, and life, &amp;c. So it is to be underſtood that Fire in its firſt ſignifications pointeth out ſorrow and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and ſo it is, that when the Fire of God, or his fury, or anger, &amp;c. is kindled in the ſoule of man in the condemning property of the light which is in the Conſcience, and the ſpirit of man findeth it ſelfe deprived of the love of God, and nothing but the fury of the Lord poured out, and that nothing but woe and want appeareth in the ſoule, and ſin abounding, which is as fuell to the Fire of the anger which he feeleth within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; when this cometh to be truly kindled, there is great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that minde, and this fire muſt all ſouls be brought into before they be fit for knowing how good Chriſt is; for this was the way that he went himſelfe even, under the wrathfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Juſtice of the Father, paſſing through the fire of his indignation: and ſo as the Paſchal Lambe was roſted at the fire, it kept all the ſweetneſſe and vertue in it ſelfe, by which it was more pleaſant to the taſte, and truly nouriſhing; ſo Chriſt by going through the fire of the anger of God, became to bee made pleaſant to all thoſe who taſte him, and none can taſte or eate him rightly, but ſuch as have their Soules brought into the ſame fire, or ſufferings with Chriſt, and ſo can cloſe with Chriſt as a ſuffering Chriſt, and bearing the ſame indignation with him, and owne him in that way, and walke with him in that way in the daily denying of ſelfe; and this Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe left in command to all that would be his Diſciples, and in this alſo would he have them to remember him ſo often, as they ſhould eate that Bread, and drink that Cup.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Paſchall Lambe was to bee eaten with bitter Herbs, which holdeth out the daily ſorrowes, and ſufferings of theſe Soules, who doe taſte of the conſolations of Chriſt; and as the ſoure Sauce is uſed to ſweet meat to help the ſtomack to digeſt well, ſo that no ſurfeit cometh by the ſweetneſſe of the meat; ſo afflictions are the only preſervative of the Soule, leaſt conſolation cauſe diſtemper: and this the Apoſtle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth by the prick in the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. And Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe maketh this out to his Diſciples, when he told them of the ſorrow they ſhould have in his abſence; yet he bad them be of good comfort, for he would come againe to them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.18. and this he would have them to remember alſo. I could have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118484:33"/>proceeded further in the explanation of the Paſchall Lambe in other particulars, but what is ſaid I hope may ſuffice, and bee enough for the matter in hand, ſpeaking only of the time when Chriſt inſtituted this Type, ſo I will goe on a little, and ſpeake a word of the matter in this Type. As for the matter, you know it was the elementary things, viz. Bread and Wine, and the Bread was ſuch as the Paſſeover was kept with, <hi>viz.</hi> unleavened Bread, which was not made by Art, or had any mixture of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe or ſourneſſe in it, but had all the ſweetneſſe that the nature of the graine afforded; as for Bread, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in its originall, community, and properties.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the Originall, it is of the vigour and vertuall ſtrength of the earth, which doth give and communicate it ſelf into the Grain caſt into it, whereby the ſame receiveth life, and ſo is brought out, and brought on ſtill to its maturity, and fitneſſe for the uſe of man.</p>
               <p>Secondly for its community, as the Grain by being caſt into the earth, and lying in the wombe thereof, the earth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth its vigour and ſtrength into it; ſo the Bread being caſt into the ſtomack it doth communicate the ſame vigour recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the earth, into the corporality of the fleſhly ſubſtance of man, and ſo by way of communication the body hath its ſupport from its originall, <hi>viz.</hi> the earth. And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the properties of Bread is to give life and ſtrength, and keep away weakneſſe and death from the body, and this Bread Chriſt made choyſe of, to typifie what was the vertue of himſelfe, and therefore he ſaid by way of Metaphor, <hi>This is my Body, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Body of Chriſt typified by Bread, was not that corporall Body which was then viſible amongſt them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it that Body that he bad them eate, for that corporall Body of Chriſt it ſelfe was but a Type, and whatſoever he acted or ſuffered in that Body were al typical, having them a in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſignification, and Chriſt himſelfe witneſſeth the truth, when he ſaid, he would give the Diſciples his Fleſh to eate, which ſaying was a ſtumbling block to many that heard him; which when he perceived he told them plainly, That his Fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> his corporall Body did not profit, but it was the Spirit that quickeneth, and that the words he ſpake they were ſpirit and life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.63. So here is to be underſtood Chriſt in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſubſtance, and not in the Corporal; and this Spirituall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118484:34"/>ſubſtance is the Divine Nature, which hath in it ſelfe theſe things typified by the Bread, <hi>viz.</hi> its originall from the Father, and of the ſame nature and ſubſtance with him, oned with him in unity, as the Graine is one with the earth, and of the ſame nature and ſubſtance,, not differing in community, but they differ in matter and likeneſſe in the coporality; ſo Chriſt and the Father are diſtinct in reſpect of the matter and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the corporality, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fleſh, while he lives in it, but did not differ from the Father in union, as himſelfe faith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.11. which unity conſiſteth of the originall communion in the eternal ſubſtantiality of the being of God, and from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, ſubſtantiall, and eſſentiall being, or Divine nature proceedeth theſe properties held out to us by the Bread, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſtrengthen and give life, and to keep weakneſſe and death from the ſoules of thoſe who have the Divine nature in them, and ſuch ſoules by the community and vertue of the ſame nature become incorporated into the union of the Father, and theſe Souls by the properties of the Divine nature or Spirit, brought into the ſame ſubſtance of its originall, and receiveth all its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and nutriment from the ſame, as the branch doth from the Vine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. and as that Bread had no Leaven mixed in it, ſo the Divine nature hath no mixture in it, but what is in it ſelfe, and will not admit of any Leaven, <hi>viz.</hi> any of the Creatures Art, Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. and this was the Leaven Chriſt bad his Diſciples beware of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16, 6. and the Soules of men becometh to be made partakers of the Divine nature by way of pure beleeving, which ariſeth out of the operation of Divine nature it ſelfe, and not out of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Type, for that is but Hiſtoricall, and looketh upon Chriſt in the Human Nature, and this is but the faith of Hypocrites, and that will periſh, <hi>Iob</hi> 8.13. but the faith which is of the operation of the Divine nature is that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> and by it the ſoule liveth, and abideth in the Divine nature it ſelfe, and thereof is made partaker; and in this reſpect the Divine nature typified by Chriſts fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh to be meat indeed, <hi>Io.</hi> 6. and this would Chriſt have his followers to know and live in, and thus would he have them to diſcerne him, and underſtand his ſaying, and what he meant when he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body, &amp;c.</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were blinde in the myſterie, therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> blamed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118484:34"/>them much, and giveth them a caveat of the unworthy and not right eating of that Bread, &amp;c. and how that not right eating did indanger them much, becauſe they in their eating did not diſcerne the Lords Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe for the other Elementary matter, viz. Wine, its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall is from the earth, which giveth life and nutriment to the Vine, whereby the fruit is brought out to maturity, out of which the Wine is produced, and the properties of the Wine is Payſicall, purifying, and refreſhing, being ſeaſonably taken; but on the contrary, it is damageable and hurtfull, and this fruit of the Vine Chriſt uſed in this Type, becauſe of the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing properties thereof, with the properties of his owne Blood; now the Blood of Chriſt is to be underſtood in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſence, viz. Typicall, and Spirituall, typicall in the blood of the corporall fleſh, which was ſhed, or let out upon the Croſſe, but in this his corporall Blood was no more vertue then was in the corporall fleſh, and that profiteth nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Type, but that Blood which is ſaving is ſpirituall, iſſuing out of the Divine nature of Chriſt, and that is his love, and this love is the life of Chriſt, and blood ſignifieth life, as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.4, 5. and this blood, or love of Chriſt which proceedeth, or is ſhed out of the Divine nature of his ſpirituall ſubſtance, hath theſe properties in it, <hi>viz.</hi> Phyſicall, purifying, and refreſhing; firſt Phyſicall, for thoſe ſoules who have had the ſame iſſuing out of the Divine nature into them, knoweth that they have been recovered of divers Diſeaſes by the ſame, which diſeaſes is the bitter tormentings of the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conſcience, who keepeth the Soule in great paine under the laſhes of Juſtice, and under the ſhadow of death, and under the bondage of the Devill, and under the paine of Hell; all theſe being of power to torment, while the hand writing of Ordinances is unblotted by the ſame blood, or love of Chriſt, and thoſe ſoules who are Soule-ſick under theſe, ſtands in need of Phyſick, and to them Chriſt becometh a Phyſician, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.31. by the ſhedding of his blood, or love, out of the Divine nature into theſe Soules, by vertue of which they come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to health.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His blood iſſuing out of the Divine Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh purifying, and purgeth the ſoul from that which is the cauſe of all its diſeaſes and pain, <hi>viz.</hi> ſin and ſelfneſs, for that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118484:35"/>is the cauſe of all ſorrow; and where this love of God, or blood of the Divine Nature is ſhed in the hearts, there ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh purged out by the power of faith, which worketh by love. And this faith God uſeth as an inſtrument in the purging by love, which made the Apoſtle ſay, that God put no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Gentile and the Jew, purifying <hi>their hearts by faith, Acts</hi> 15.9. Now this faith is always accompanied with ſuffering, as in nature, purging is ſome cauſe of pain, but this faith which is grounded in love, overcometh the World, with all the glory thereof, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. And it beareth up the heart in all afflictions and tribulations, making one vertue to ariſe out of another, as <hi>tribulation begetteth patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in your hearts, Rom.</hi> 5.4, 5. So as the ſoul is purged from ſin, both in affection and action; ſo is the conſcience purged from its blindneſs, by which it kept the ſoul in bondage to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actings; and the captivity of weak ordinances which cauſe the ſoul to look at Chriſt in a fleſhly way, and in its blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tormented the ſoul, when it would not know Chriſt ſo; and the truth of this purging the Apoſtle witneſſeth, as you may ſee in <hi>Heb</hi> 9.14.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever hath this love of God, or blood of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature ſhed in their hearts, the vertue thereof doth ingraft that ſoul into Chriſt in his Divine Nature (by the way of pure loving, and pure beleeving) as the Branch into the Vine, and every branch ſo ingrafted into him, and bearing fruit in him, <hi>he purgeth and maketh it bring out more fruit, Joh.</hi> 15.2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The property of this blood of the Divine Nature, is to comfort and revive the ſoul, for whom, and in whom it is ſhed; for when the ſoul hath undergone the bitterneſs of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of ſin, by way of affliction, and have paſſed through all the ſorrows and ſufferings of death, devil, and hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the powers of the ſoul became much weakned, and the heart broken to peeces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then by the vertual property of this blood, the ſpirit is revived and comforted, as may be ſeen <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this was that water that Chriſt ſpake of to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4.10. And thus his blood becometh drink indeed, <hi>John</hi> 6.55. And who ſo eateth his fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his blood in this manner, live in the Divine Nature of Chriſt, and Chriſt by the Divine Nature dwelleth in that ſoul, and ſuch
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118484:35"/>a ſoul ſhall not ſee death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.51. But whoſo eateth or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Body and Blood of Jeſus, any other way, the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a ſtumbling block to them; and as the effect of Wine is to hurt and breed ill humor, and dazel the brain, when it is not taken in moderation with wiſdom in its vertual properties, (but when mens luſt cauſeth them to drink the ſame) then do they befool themſelves in it, for want of wiſdom, and ſo thereby they oft become to be made weak and ſickly, yea, and many are brought to death thereby: Even ſo the Blood of Chriſt being drunk in a wrong ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> by way of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical faith, which looketh upon Chriſt in the fleſh, and making applications of what he ſuffered in the fleſh; and ſo taketh the efficacy from the Divine Nature, and giveth the ſame to the humane or corporal nature; This Faith, or looking upon, or eating, or drinking of his fleſh and blood, becometh to work no other work in theſe ſouls, but onely keepeth luſt, ſin, or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alive; and ſo by this falſe faith, Chriſt is made the cloak of ſin, and the Miniſter thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. And becauſe the ſons of men have neither wills, nor wiſdom to examine themſelves in this very thing; therefore much weakneſs is in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that they cannot know the truth <hi>as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and much weakneſs is in their wills, in fighting againſt ſin; and therefore that ſin being unpurged out, it becometh cauſe of much ſickneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoul having an iſſue of blood, becauſe the veins thereof is looſened, and ſo it is carried out to love, ſeek, and live in created, or things acted; and by this means, ſuch ſickneſs, if not cured, bringeth death. And this was the very thing that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would have the people to take heed of, when they were to obſerve this Type, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for the matters in this Type, I will let them paſs with theſe ſmall hints, and will proceed and ſpeak a word of the manner of this Type, or the Form Chriſt uſed therein, <hi>viz.</hi> He took bread and bleſſed it, and brake it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which bleſſing is to be underſtood ſanctifying, which holds out the power and vertue of the God-head in it ſelf, which vertue and power was in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by the ſame he ſanctified himſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.17. by which he bleſſeth and ſanctifieth all who live in him, and he in them, and in this caſe he is our ſanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> And likewiſe, he brake the bread, breaking being the parting of a thing into peeces, whereby many may be partakers of the ſame, which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118484:36"/>holdeth out the fulneſs and wholeneſs of the Divine Nature, which doth freely and liberally diſperſe it ſelf into ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that many may be made partakers thereof, not that the Divine Nature is, or can be parted, or divided in itſelf, no more then the Sun in the Firmament, which remaineth whole in it ſelf; yet all are partakers of the light and heat thereof: So the Divine Nature is whole and undividable in it ſelf, but by its fulneſs doth fill ſo many particular Creatures; and herein ſtandeth the diviſion in reſpect of the corporallity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the fulneſs of the Divine Nature is whole in it ſelf, and by its fulneſs and freeneſs, doth fill all particular ſouls. And this truth <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> verifieth, where he ſaith, <hi>Of his fulneſs have we all received, &amp;c. Iohn</hi> 1.16. And the fulneſs of the Divine Nature iſſuing out of it ſelf into any ſoul, doth draw the ſame into its own nature, whereby the ſame is made fit to live in the ſame nature, and by the living in it, that ſoul becometh rooted, and grounded in the ſame, whereby it is made able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with all Saints, <hi>what is the bredth and length, height and depth, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo becometh to be filled with <hi>all the fulneſs of God, Eph.</hi> 3.17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when he had ſhewed the Diſciples the freeneſs of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine Nature, breaking out or darting it ſelf into each ſeveral ſoul, typified to them by that form of breaking the bread: Then he gave the ſame to them, that they might eat it, and told them in a myſtical ſence, that it was his body that was broken for them, as is partly ſhewed before. And this form in the Type inſtituted, had a ſympathizing with, and to that Type of his corporal body, ready to be ſacrificed and rent in peeces upon the croſs, till its coporal life was taken from it; which holdeth out the renting to peeces the body of ſin in us, and the death of the ſame upon the croſs of ſelf-denial, which is holden out by the form and manner of eating: eating ſignifieth bruſing or ſuffering, being typified by the bitter herbs in eating the Paſchal Lamb; For as eating, bruiſeth and maketh the thing eaten to be fit for digeſtion, whereby the ſame is turned into the ſame ſubſtance of fleſh; So afflictions and ſufferings maketh us partakers with Chriſt and of Chriſt, and to drink of the ſame Cup, and to be baptized with him into his death, and by the vertue thereof, the body of ſin becometh deſtroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4.</p>

               <p>And this Chriſt would have them to know when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to eat that bread, that as in eating it, they bruiſed it in peeces; ſo it was that body of ſin in them that was the cauſe why the juſtice of his Father bruiſed and brake his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body, and to be avenged of that body of ſin in them, he would make them partakers of the Divine Nature; and that was by way of ſuffering, whereby that body of ſin ſhould be deſtroyed: And that in theſe afflictions, the pure believing might be raiſed in the ſoul, that thereby the Divine Nature might be made ſuitable for digeſtion, and ſo turned into the nature of the ſoul, and the ſoul into its nature, by vertue of the blood or love of the ſame nature; that ſo he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, may be one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, the manner or form in this Type was further, <hi>viz.</hi> in taking the Cup and giving of thanks, and bidding them drink it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for giving thanks, it is a well-pleaſingneſs in the ſoul, with what God doth or will do with it, and a free ſubmitting to the Fathers will, wherein his goodneſs is made manifeſted, whereat and wherein the ſoul rejoyceth, under any affliction; and ſo it was, that Chriſt rejoyced in what was the will of his Father, and in obedience to his will he was willing to lay down his life; and by this he ſhewed to his Diſciples, what he would have them to do, when like afflictions ſhould betide them, and thoſe who were his followers, in whom the Divine Nature was livingly felt, and by its vertue had daſhed in peeces the body of ſin; and by the blood of that nature, <hi>viz,</hi> Love, theſe ſouls was incorporated into the ſame nature, theſe followed the ſame example, and in ſuffering could be well pleaſed, witneſs hereof is the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs? &amp;c. Now in all theſe things we are more then conquerors, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.34, 35, 36, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further Chriſt told his Diſciples, that that Cup was the Blood of the New Teſtament which was ſhed for many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which typical ſaying, was ſignified the eſtabliſhing of the ſecond Covenant, promiſed before of his Father, by the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Behold the day cometh, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c. And I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, &amp;c.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118484:37"/>Iere.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which promiſe our Saviour came to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil, and at this time inſtituted this Type, giving out the truth thereof, in this his myſtical ſaying; and the compleat fulfilling hereof, is in the ſouls of thoſe who be incorporated into the Divine Nature, whereby they become to have that law of God, <hi>viz.</hi> The righteouſneſs of God; which righteouſneſs is Chriſt, or the Divine Nature ſtamped upon their hearts, by which they know the truth of God in that Covenant, and doth ſet to their ſeal that God is true, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.33. And by the power and vertue of the ſame, they are taught to know the truth, and needeth not that any teach them; becauſe the ſame anointing in them, teacheth them all things, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27.</p>
               <p>And thus are theſe ſouls made to own God for their God, and live in the love and life of him, united to him by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Covenant, and ſo becoming his people owned by him, and wholly ſet apart for himſelf, in and through the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of himſelf by his own Spirit.</p>
               <p>But what might be ſaid more upon this particular, in the manner of this Type I let paſs, becauſe ſomewhat that might be ſaid is ſomewhat touched before in ſpeaking of the material things in this Type; and I would not too much over-load weak underſtandings, with too much ſpeaking of things that be too hard and heavy for them: So I proceed to ſpeak a word of the end in this Type, for which Chriſt inſtituted it, which was for this very purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That now when the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was at hand, and that his bodily preſence was to be taken away from the world; therefore he would not leave the ſons of men without ſome rememberance of himſelf, and what he had ſaid unto them; the which he would have them to take notice of, when he was gone, and that his ſuffering ſhould be kept ſtill in minde; and though the Type of his own Body ſhould not abide amongſt them, yet he would leave them another Type inſtead of that, whereby they ſhould ſtill be put in minde of him. And this was to be to them as a glimpſe of light, ſhining in a dark place, until the Sun it ſelf aroſe, and became as a light that ſhineth more and more, until the perfect day; and that while the ſons of men were in their weakneſs, before they were brought into the pure and perfect knowledge, and full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf in the Divine Nature, this was left to be as a mark in the way, leaſt by forgetfulneſs men might happily ſtep
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118484:37"/>out of their way, in following him to the death of the Croſſe, and that was the chieſeſt thing which hee commanded, and would have them to remember: and Chriſt left not this Type only, but he made to them (who were his followers) a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſending the Spirit to them, who when he came ſhould bring all that he had ſaid into their remembrance, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.26. and this death of Chriſt in the corporall Fleſh was ſtill ſet before the eyes of thoſe who were his deareſt friends, and trueſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and it was the thing they ſtill preſſed after, to ſee how neare they could come to follow Chriſt in the way of the Croſs, that thereby the body of Sin and Self might be crucified, and dye with the Body of Jeſus, that ſo the Divine nature might live and grow in them, whereby they might be made partakers with Chriſt in the Reſurrection; and this made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> weigh little of either conſolation or affliction, religious walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any created thing, ſo long as he had not attained to the reſurrection of the dead, as you may ſee in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11, 12, &amp;c. and all that he deſired to know amongſt thoſe whom hee taught, was Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. and ſo by the preſſing after Chriſt in the way of the Croſſe, he became dead to all things whatſoever, whether the Law, or World, or what might be had in any thing acted, or created, and became crucified in his affections to all with Chriſt, and he lived in the Divine nature of Chriſt, it living in him, as may be ſeene, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>And further, he plainly demonſtrateth, that they which be Chriſts have both their affectious and luſts crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. and all his owne rejoycing was in the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby the world was crucified to him, and he to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. and the truth is, ſo long as the minde of Chriſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to men in the Myſtery of this Type before ſaid, they look but upon Chriſt in a fleſhly way, being blinded by Luſt, and what they conceive of him is but falſe and feigned, and ſo give that to the Type which only belongeth to the Divine nature; and this is becauſe of the faith which is Hiſtoricall and Traditionall, and from hence it is, that Chriſt cannot be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended further then he was in the Fleſh, and what he ſuffered in the Fleſh; and theſe Types he left us in the Fleſh, by which he would have drawn men more neare to himſelfe in the Divine nature, and thoſe very things which ſhould have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118484:38"/>to have drawne us into himſelfe, even by the policy of Sin and Satan, and falſe Teachers, they have drawne us from Chriſt, and ſo placeth Chriſt in Types and Forms, and in this very way you have been taught to know Chriſt, and ſo are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the enemies of his Croſſe, and therefore for all the faith you pretend to have in Chriſt, and the comfort and ſtrength you imagine to have gotten from the Type, is nothing but meere fancy, and the deluſion of the Devill, whereby he hath beguiled you, by being a lying ſpirit in the mouthes of your falſe Miniſters, for as yet the world and your owne luſts, and livelineſſe of affections to created things is yet in your heart, and if you had been taught in the right way of (apprehending Chriſt, and) following him, it might have been, your Souls might have injoyed more of the Divine nature then otherwiſe they have done, and therefore I cannot but pitty you poore blinded Soules, and out of love I have written theſe few lines unto you, if perhaps there may be ſome amongſt you who may thereby grope ſomewhat more neare the underſtanding of the truth then heretofore: and I make no doubt but that ſome will underſtand by what is here written how to conceive of Chriſt in the Fleſh, and how in the Divine nature, and how in this Type, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſover, or his laſt Supper, and I hope you will learne in time to know in a more cleare way how to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and injoy more of the ſufferings with Chriſt then you ever yet have done, and and ſo become more pure and right partakers of the Divine nature it ſelfe, then ever you have done in the outward Type, and out-ſide forme, but I ſomething doubt, that while your falſe Teachers (who have the lying ſpirit in them) have power to deſtroy you, they will ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, therefore as you love your owne Soules beware of them, and ſay not but that a friend giveth you warning of them.</p>
               <p>But in concluding of this Type inſtituted by Chriſt, I would have you further to underſtand in briefe the ſumme of all what hath been formerly held out, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuffering with Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, and the fellowſhip or communion with Chriſt in the Divine nature: for herein ſtandeth, and is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the whole duty of every one who will be Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for in ſuffering we have communion with him as he was in the Fleſh, in which we muſt follow him to the very death
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118484:38"/>upon the Croſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in living in the daily denying our ſelves both inwardly and outwardly; inwardly, by keeping our thoughts, deſires, and affections out of loving and living, of, and in any thing below the communion of the Father and the Sonne, by the partaking of the Divine nature; and when wee by true examination of our owne hearts finde them bending downe into earthly objects (of what kinde ſoever) then to draw back our hearts from them, and beating downe all the objects as they riſe, or be preſented to the heart (or will) and hereby man ſhall come to know the evill of his owne heart, whereby his affliction inwardly ſhall be much increaſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall be made a ſuitable companion for Chriſt in the way of ſuffering, in which the Soule becometh to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellowſhip with Chriſt, and in this fellowſhip the Apoſtle deſired to know Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And for the outward ſufferings they very much help the Soule into the fellowſhip of Chriſt, and theſe bee of divers ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> loſſe of goods, loſſe of health, loſſe of friends, and relations, loſſe of the praiſe of men, loſſe of the pleaſure in the world, &amp;c. all which man may ſuffer the loſſe of by accident, or to ſay, by the hand and worke of God; and to theſe may be added other ſufferings of the Fleſh in the outward ſelf-denial <hi>viz.</hi> by taking no more of the Creature then will ſerve for the uphold and ſupport of the body, neither in meat, drinke, nor apparrell, &amp;c. and this all men ought to obſerve, that will follow Chriſt in the fellowſhip of his ſuffering, for whatſoever man taketh more of the Creature then is before ſaid, the ſame is for keeping luſt alive, and addeth fuell to the fire; but theſe outward ſufferings will not bring man into the true fellowſhip of the communion of the ſuffering with Chriſt, without the inward ſuffering (before ſaid) goe along with the outward ſuffering, for by both the Soule is rightly fit to be partaker with Chriſt in ſuffering. And when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had to doe with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about ſome afflictions under which they were, and to let them know, that thoſe who would follow Chriſt muſt beare him company in ſuffering, and not ſtart back from it, nor turne aſide from Chriſt in that fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, therefore he ſets before them the example of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Wilderneſſe, who were all Baptized in the Sea; which was as much as to enter into Covenant with God, to abide all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118484:39"/>ſufferings that after ſhould come upon them before they came to the Land of reſt, and yet the moſt of them proved unfaith full in, the time of their ſuffering, and ſo came ſhort of entring into the Land; and he tells them theſe things hapned for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and admonitions, &amp;c. and tels them that no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had taken them but ſuch as were common to men, &amp;c. and in the concluſion he ſets before them this Type of our Saviours, and as wiſe men he would have them to judge what he ſaid, and tels them, <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of Chriſt, and the bread which we breake,</hi> &amp;c. and then ſheweth them that onedneſſe of all the followers of Chriſt, and with Chriſt by the being partakers of that one Bread which held out to them the fellowſhip and communion of the ſuffering with Chriſt; and this you may ſee in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1. &amp;c. to the 18. But no more of this Type inſtituted by Chriſt, but I proceed on to another principle in your Religion, and that is Baptiſme; and in ſhort will ſhew you your errour in the ſame, if perhaps ſome of you have eyes to ſee, and hearts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth when it is declared, and opened plainly to you. Now for this forme of Baptiſme it is another Type, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſo called was the firſt Miniſter of the ſame, and afterward collerated by Chriſt, in coming to be Baptiſed himſelfe, and afterwards gave further approbation of the ſame by way of command to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. But as in his other Type beforeſaid (inſtituted and commanded by Chriſt) you have erred, in giving that to the Type which belongeth to the thing ſignified by it; So in this alſo you doe the ſame, for though you have ſome ground in Scripture for the forme of Baptiſme, yet you are ignorant of the minde of Chriſt in his command, as you ſhall ſee afterward; and for the very forme it ſelfe you doe but follow it by tradition, received from the blinde Prieſts, who themſelves have received the ſame by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo as they have received the ſame, ſo they teach you, and ſo you beleeve, but neither you, nor the Prieſts have any ſure ground in Scripture for uſing this type in the manner, or perſons to whom you have it adminiſtred, <hi>viz.</hi> Infants, for no ſure ground you have for this your act, but only your good thinking, which leadeth you to doe the ſame; and your good thinking is but grounded upon Inferences, and conſequences, drawne from uncertainties; but I ſtand not upon diſputations,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118484:39"/>neither do I meane in this my diſcourſe to diſpute about forms, which is but weake and beggerly things, for I will leave this to your ſelves, and to the Anabaptiſts to diſpute, being both you and they live in forms, and can envie one another in your forms, and perſecute one another for your forms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongſt your ſelves you are the meeteſt to end that thing, either by your diſputations, or by your ſwords. But as for me, I have no calling to meddle any further in your wiſe diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your forms; but my call is to let you both ſee how you are but fooles in your forms, that thereby you may both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſe in that which is the power and true wiſdome it ſelfe, without which you ſhall all periſh in your forms.</p>
               <p>Now in the firſt place I come to ſpeake a word of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions you draw from this Type of Baptiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is an holy thing, and that by adminiſtring the ſame to Infants they become incorporated into Chriſt; and in caſe any Infant dye before it be Baptiſed, you queſtion whether it goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or no, and in caſe one live and be not baptiſed, that he is not, or cannot be incorporated into Chriſt, and ſo you make this type a god, or a chriſt by way of conſequence; though you deny the ſame with your tongues: and I doe poſitively deny all your concluſions, and the conſequence drawne from your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions is made a God: this I doe affirme, and will prove the truth both of what I deny, and what I affirme; now your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions being four-fold, I come to the firſt, viz. that Baptiſme is holy, which I both deny, and confeſſe; this may ſeem Logicall, but it is not ſo, as you ſhall ſee in defining my owne ſpeech, Firſt, I confeſſe it may be called holy, as ſometimes outward and created things had that Epithite put upon them, when they were ſet apart for ſomepious end, as the Veſſels in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and other materials belonging to it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31.6. and likewiſe things in the times of the Law, which was choſen and ſet apart for the Sacrifices, and ſo the Scriptures is called holy, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. and ſo the workes of men is ſometimes called ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but all theſe are but called holy in reſpect of the end, and the thing pointed out, or ſignified; and this is but an outward or externall holineſſe, and this I confeſſe: But that holineſſe which you blindly put upon outward things, or types, that I deny, and ſo in this type of Baptiſme I deny any further holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then what is externall, and all externall holineſſe a man
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118484:40"/>may have, and act and live in all the particulars thereof, and yet goe to beare the Devils company in Hell with it, if he have no more, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <p>But yet you will deny that you give any holineſſe to this type but what belongeth to it, the which I ſhall confute in ſpeaking of your ſecond concluſion, wherein you affirme, that by the adminiſtrings of the ſame a childe becometh incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ingrafted into Chriſt, the which is a falſe and blinde concluſion, without any ground in Scripture, and this you have received by tradition from the Popiſh fictions, and in this your concluſion you have made this type no leſſe then God himſelfe, as here I prove it: for there is no act of any creature can ingraft into Chriſt, and this is no more I hope then the act of a creature, and but a bodily worke, and bodily ſervice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And our Saviour who gave out the command for obſerving of this type (yet at another time) ſaid, <hi>When you have done all, yet count your ſelves unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> Luke 7.10. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Not to him that worketh, but to him that beleeveth is righteouſneſſe aſcribed,</hi> Rom. 4.5. and all workes of the Creature, though in the pureſt way in any duty, or ordinance, which all is but externall righteouſneſſe, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holineſſe, all theſe are but as filthy Garments, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous cloathes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.9. then if it be true what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay, the which you cannot deny, then are you of thoſe whom you call Anti-Scripturians, for thoſe are they that walk contrary to Scripture by tradition, and though you confeſſe the truth with your tongue, yet in your actions you deny the ſame, for no Scripture will beare you out, in ſaying that any externall obedience doth incorporate any ſoule into Chriſt, or to ingraft into the Divine nature, for this is but your fooliſh conceit raiſed in you, by the cuſtome of tradition, by which you have made the Commands and Power of God without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and hereby you make a god of this Ordinance, or Type inſtituted, and give that to it which of right doth belong to himſelfe, and the incorporating any ſoule into Chriſt, viz. to be made one in him, and live in him, is the worke of God himſelfe, and not any act of the Creature, for herein God get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth honour to himſelfe, in working out the ſalvation of ſouls, and his honour he will not give to another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. and it is his owne arme that bringeth ſalvation, and it is of his own will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118484:40"/>that he begetteth any to himſelfe, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.18. But I know you may object, that God worketh his worke by meanes, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth you in ordinances. To which I ſay it is true, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he hath done ſo, but yet theſe was his owne ordinances, and not the traditions of men; and yet his owne ordinances he hath not forſaken, as you may ſee by the brazen Serpent, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. and by his Tabernacle in Shilo, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.12. and by his Temple in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ier.</hi> 42.13. and the reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people made gods of them, and counted them holy, and ſo worſhipped them, giving that to the Creature which did belong to the Creator, and ſo became blinded in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not knowing how to put a difference between the Ordinance and the Ordainer; and the reaſon of this is, becauſe they became vaine in their imaginations, not knowing the minde of the Ordainer in the thing ordained; and ſo their fooliſh heart thereby being darkned, they became to ſerve &amp; worſhip the creature more then the Creator, and this is the very condition in this your act, from whence you draw your fooliſh concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and though this Ordinance of Baptiſme inſtituted by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and commended by Chriſt, be tollerable in it ſelfe ſtanding as a Type, yet the ſoule wanting the thing ſignified, the act of the type is of no efficacy to the ſoule, for if the fleſh of Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, <hi>Io.</hi> 6.63. and that bodily exerciſe profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. what profit is it that you reap in this act of Baptizing, even now but beguiling your ſelves of that which is the ſubſtance and ſafety of your ſoules, and inſtead thereof you feed your fancy by conceits, and ſo live upon huskes and ſhadowes, and types, and therefore the power of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is hid from you, and ſo you living upon ſhadowes and types, you become to dye in your ſins.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe you queſtion (if not deny) that a childe cannot be ſaved dying before Baptiſed; and indeed ſo you may, for none ſhall be ſaved but thoſe who be incorporated into the Divine nature, this being the life and bliſſe of all bleſſed ſoules; and in what you affirme in your firſt and ſecond concluſion, you may abſolutely deny that any can be ſaved before Baptiſed; for this doth undeniably follow, and as your formes and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is but errour, ſo this third drawne out of the two former is errour alſo, as here I prove plainly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I hope you dare not deny but that Circumciſion was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118484:41"/>an Ordinance of God, and yet you dare not conclude, that all that died before it was inſtituted, were damned; neither all that under went the ſame Ordinance were ſaved. And though this Baptiſm be an Ordinance, yet dare you not conclude that any was not ſaved before it was inſtituted, neither that all were ſaved who were baptiſed.</p>
               <p>Then if God had a way to ſave before the inſtitution of any Ordinance, then by the ſame way he can ſave without the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; and the truth is, by the ſame way he ſaveth under Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and therefore the ſame way he ſaveth without Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. The Ordinance it ſelf doth not ſave; and that way which God ſaveth all ſouls by, and through, is his own wiſdom, power, and righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> His Chriſt in the Divine Nature, by which he was in the Father from eternity, and by the vertue of the ſame nature ſaved ſouls before there was any Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the ſame ſaveth under Ordinances, and the ſame ſaveth without Ordinances; and it is the free-gift, or good will, or grace of God that ſaveth whoſoever are ſaved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. And therefore it is not the adminiſtring of any Ordinances, or living under any Ordinance that ſave: And therefore I conclude truly, and upon true grounds, That if children dye, or any other, though not baptiſed, may be ſaved as well as thoſe who are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and all by vertue of the Divine Nature, who is not tyed to, or given to any ſoul by any vertue that is in any Ordinance whatſoever, but doth gather and draw to it ſelf whomſoever, and at what time ſoever it ſelf pleaſeth. And therefore I would have you to take heed and beware of the falſe doctrine of your lying Prieſts, who have taught you theſe things, that thereby you might eſteem highly of them, and have them in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their acting and adminiſtring of this Ordinance to you, and making you beleeve you are more in favor and love of God, then if you wanted this their poor act.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe from theſe three former concluſions, this fourth doth ſucceſſively follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that one living, and yet unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is not, or cannot be incorporated into Chriſt; and as all the former is but error, ſo is this alſo, and clear againſt the work and ways of God, as he hath wrought, whoſe work is made manifeſt by Scripture to the contrary; for as is before proved, it is no work of any Creature, nor the vertue of any Ordinance that doth incorporate into Chriſt; but that which doth incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118484:41"/>into Chriſt, is the gift of God, and that is faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. And faith may be given of God, without the adminiſtration of an Ordinance. If you deny this, then you deny Scripture; for Faith was before Ordinance, as you may ſee in <hi>Abraham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Circumciſion; and Faith was before the ordinance of Baptiſm, and in the Primitive time this ordinance was not to be adminiſtred to any, but that was beleevers, (though fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you do adminiſter the ſame to your children, having neither command nor example for what you do, but onely a Prieſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, by which you are guided.)</p>
               <p>Therefore it is clear, That a ſoul may be incorporated into Chriſt, before and without Baptiſm; ſo all your concluſions is but falſe, and in obſerving of this Ordinance of Baptiſm, you know not what you do, nor what you obſerve; for to this very day you and your Teachers are ignorant of what was the minde of <hi>John,</hi> when he inſtituted it; and likewiſe of the minde of Chriſt in commanding, that it ſhould be obſerved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that you make a god of Baptiſm, as I have proved in ſpeaking of the fourfold concluſion: And this you have placed in your Religion as a principle, or as a mark whereby you may be known to be of the houſhold of God, and as a ſign of thoſe who are partakers of the promiſes, and contained within the New Covenant of Grace. And thus in your deceit do you live, being deceived, and deceiving one another: And you are as blinde in what you obſerve, as thoſe that never had eyes to ſee the Sun; and yet by relation of others, can believe there is a Sun: So you hear by Scripture and Relation there is a God, and ſo beleeves there is a God; but yet the Son of God you never ſaw; for as yet your eyes is faſt-cloſed; or if ſome amongſt you have a little ſight, it is but a dark glimpſe of the Son of God in theſe Ordinances; and that dark glimpſe you have, is but of Chriſt, as he was in the fleſh, and not as he is in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but as the myſtery is, that you think you ſee Chriſt or the Truth of God clearly in theſe Ordinances; and becauſe you ſay you ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth, <hi>John</hi> 9.41.</p>
               <p>But I know you may object, and ſay, That Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 3.2. ſaith, that Baptiſm ſaves now under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is true, he ſaith ſo in a figurative ſpeech, reſembling Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to the Water of the Flood, which ſaved ſome when all the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118484:42"/>reſt was drowned in the ſame; but how did the water ſave ſome, and drowned others? it was not the water it ſelfe that ſaved, but the Arke, and it was not the Arke could ſave, but the living and abiding in the Arke; and the water and the Arke together did ſave the perſons in the Arke; for though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſay, that theſe perſons were ſaved by water, how was it that they were ſaved by water, ſeeing it was water that would have deſtroyed them as well as the reſt, and yet the ſame water ſaved from the deſtruction of it ſelfe? I will tell you how the water ſaved the Perſons from its owne deſtruction, even by its weakneſſe it had to ſave, and the nature of it being knowne to be deſtroying to them that ſhould be overtaken with it, from whence the knowledge of the Perſons directed them into the Arke; and thus was the water an inſtrument, by cauſing feare to ariſe in the Perſons, by which feare they preſſed into the Arke, wherein they were ſaved; for the water ſaved as it was an inſtrument to drive the Perſons into the Arke, but the Arke it ſelfe was the chief cauſe of their ſaving, by their abiding in it; and ſo the Apoſtle reſembleth Baptiſme to it, with the thing ſignified, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead; for as the water ſaved as beforeſaid from the deſtruction of it ſelfe, ſo doth Baptiſme as an inſtrument ſave all thoſe who know the weakneſſe of that type, and from the knowledge of the weakneſſe of it, fearing to be deſtroyed by abiding in it; thereby the ſoule is led from depending on it, and ſo runneth into the Arke, <hi>viz.</hi> into the death of Chriſt by the croſſe of ſelf-deniall, and ſo into the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, <hi>viz.</hi> not to looke at Chriſt in the fleſh, but in the Divine nature, by the power of which the ſoule is compaſſed about, and ſaved from the danger of all things acted, or created, and thus farre Baptiſme ſaveth ſo farre as the weakneſſe of it is knowne, and the danger in it manifeſted, and ſo becometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall, to direct and drive the ſoule out of it ſelfe into the thing ſignified; but as the water deſtroyed all that abode in it without the Arke, even ſo doth Baptiſme deſtroy all ſoules who live in the forme or type thereof, and yet is not incloſed about, or incorporated into the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and abideth in him according as he is in the Divine nature: and as the perſons could not be ſaved if they kept not in the Arke, no more can any foule be ſafe but as it abideth in the Divine nature,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118484:42"/>as the branch in the Vine, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.1, 2. But I ſay no more at preſent of this type of Baptiſme, becauſe it may be you ſhall heare ſomewhat more of it afterwards, and I hope by what is ſaid you may partly underſtand your errour in your fooliſh concluſions upon it, and not to be deceived by the falſe lying ſpirit of your blinde Prieſts; ſo I proceed to ſpeake a word of another principle in your Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer.</p>
               <p>Now as for Prayer I know there be many commands in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, and many examples alſo; but for ſet times, and ſet formes, and in prayer you have none, according as you uſe it.</p>
               <p>As for the times of prayer which you uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> uſually eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and morning, you have neither command nor example in Scripture, but only this you follow by tradition, and being led to obſerve the ſame by your good thinking, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of your blinded Conſcience being wrong informed by the Doctors of errour, who limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and circumſcribe him in a place, and draweth formes and Images of him, according to their fancy and imagination, and ſo have framed a fantaſticall or imaginary worſhip to him, and in that fantaſtick way have learned to call upon him, and ſo have ſet out to your ſelves theſe ſet times, at which times you can call upon your imaginary God, that he will heare your fained prayers, and forgive you your conceited ſin, and ſupply the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary want of your ſoules; and likewiſe you can praiſe him for his imaginary mercies beſtowed upon your ſoules, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe a great deale of other hypocriticall repetitions, to fill up your houre, and when that is done then all is well with you, and then heart goe whether thou wilt with thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for holy duty it is performed, and ſo by this meanes your hearts is let out to goe a whoring all the day long, and ſeeketh fellowſhip and communion with, and in created things, and ſo your thoughts, fears, cares, lover, and deſires is carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your chiefe God, <hi>viz.</hi> the world, or ſomething contained in it, for it being your treaſure, it hath your heart, <hi>for where the treaſure is, there is your heart,</hi> Mat. 6.21. and looke what hath moſt of your thoughts that is your god, and if you look into your ſelves you ſhall finde, that the Creature hath more of your thoughts then that God you prayed to in the morning, but it mattereth not what your hearts be about all the day long, for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118484:43"/>you have that at command which will cure all, and that is your evening ſacrifice, and duty of prayer; and from hence it is, that you by your choſen times for prayer, have become igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the ground of prayer, and having forſaken the ground of prayer, and chuſing to your ſelves a ſet time for prayer, the contrary effects is produced, <hi>viz.</hi> prayer proceeding from the right ground is a meane whereby ſin is kept from the heart and affections, and the heart with the affections is kept from ſin; but when the ground is changed into ſet times, thereby the heart with the affections getteth liberty to ſinne, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath freedome to enter upon the heart, and thus your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is turned into ſinne, and this you have by asking, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving counſell of your blinde Prieſt, and hereby you make a cover for your ſelves, that you may adde ſin to ſin; this you may plainly ſee in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1. but thoſe who knew, or doe know the true ground of Prayer were never tied to ſet times, but to occaſions, and the occaſions being ſo many made our Saviour give out this caveat ſo oft, <hi>Watch and pray,</hi> Mar. 13.33. and the Apoſtle who knew the ground of prayer, and the many occaſions to pray, made him bid the <hi>Theſſalonians pray without ceaſing,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.17. and thoſe who know the evill of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall not need to have one to teach them when to pray, or how to pray, neither can they be tyed to ſet times, for they ſhall finde that ſin in themſelves that cannot bee limited to times, and therefore they cannot limit themſelves to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it at times, for (to thoſe) both ſin and prayer is unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable; and this made the Apoſtle utter his deſire in the well-wiſhing of thoſe whom hee taught in the truth, and right knowledge of God and themſelves, and willed them to pray every where, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the forme you uſe in your prayer, it is but your owne human invention which cauſeth you to ſtraine your braine, drawing out from thence ſo many words, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſpeech, and to fill up your houre is oft put to uſe the ſame words over and over, and ſo contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Saviour you uſe vaine repetitions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7.</p>
               <p>And herein you differ not from the Heathens, for they think to be heard for their much ſpeaking; and this your beat-braine <hi>Duty</hi> is but the ſacrifice of fooles, and yet you know not that you doe evill, but this your doing pleaſeth your ſelfe, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118484:43"/>pacifieth your blinde Conſcience, and from hence you draw concluſions, that God is pleaſed alſo, making him ſuch a one as your ſelves, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.21. but thoſe who know the right ground of prayer they are not tyed to times, neither are they tyed to a forme in prayer, for the true ground of prayer turne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſet times into occaſions, and it turneth ſelfe formes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions into ſhort and feeling expreſſions; yea, oft times ſuch expreſſions as you could not heare, if you were beſides the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who uttereth theſe expreſſions, and thoſe are the cryes that ring and eccho in the eares of the Lord of Hoſts, and theſe are the prayers that prevaileth with the Lord, in anſwering and filling the deſires of ſuch ſoules, and theſe prayers and cryes are the very vigorous out-pourings of the Spirit, which maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for the Saints, and he who is a Spirit knoweth the minde of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. and in this manner <hi>Moſes</hi> (who knew the right ground of prayer) called upon the Lord in his greateſt diſtreſſe, not ſo much as ſpeaking one word that any of the people heard, and yet his ſpirit cryed out ſo vehemently to the Lord that the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Wherefore cryeſt thou unto me?</hi> and all that while his ſpirit was calling upon the Lord with his tongue, he was admoniſhing the people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the Lord, as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.13, 14, 15, &amp;c. And in this manner <hi>Hannah</hi> poured out her prayer to God, and prevailed with him in the thing ſhe deſired, though <hi>Eli</hi> before he knew the truth accounted her a drunkard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13, 14. but the truth is, that you know not the right ground of prayer, and therefore you cannot depart from your ſet times, and ſet formes, and therefore you aske and receive not, becauſe you aske amiſſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3, And the reaſon why you have not the right ground of prayer is, becauſe you know not God but as a Perſon, and not as he is a Spirit; and you know not the wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, and power of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his Chriſt, but according to the fleſh, and therefore all your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (and holy duties, as you call them) is framed according to the knowledge that you have of God, and Chriſt, and this knowledge you have is no more but by relation of others, as you have heard and ſeen in the Scriptures, and the ſpeaking thereof, by your relative Prieſts; and from hence it is that you have formed in your heads an Hiſtoricall faith, and fantaſtick beleeving, for as yet you have not been in the City of God, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118484:44"/>what you have heard and ſeen therein you cannot ſpeake of, and no further then you have knowledge of God you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve God, and no further then you can beleeve God can you call upon him, and what God is in his Spirituall being you have not yet beleeved, then <hi>how can you call on him in whom you have not beleeved?</hi> Rom. 10.12. and why is it that you have not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeved, even becauſe you have not rightly heard of God? and why is it that you have not rightly heard of God, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not had him rightly preached to you by your Prieſts, and the reaſon why they could not rightly declare and preach God (as he is a Spirit, and Chriſt, as he was, and is in the Divine nature) is, becauſe they were never ſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15.</p>
               <p>But I know that you may object againſt me, and ſay, that you you have ſome examples in Scripture, both for your ſet times and ſet forms of prayer; for you will ſay, that <hi>David</hi> praiſed at even, morning, and at noon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that our Saviour himſelf prayed at ſundry times, and the Apoſtles themſelves uſed prayer in this manner very oft with others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, I do not deny vocal prayer, and times for vocal prayer, in caſe the right ground of prayer be in the perſon or perſons praying; for I would have you to underſtand what I have formerly ſaid; for I do not deny, but confeſs occaſional praying, but that which I deny, is the ſet-times and ſet-forms of prayer, which is but good thinkings, rules, and blinde Prieſts precepts, without any command, or example in Scripture; but vocal prayer occaſionally, the perſons rightly grounded, this is all, that you or any can gather out of any example in Scripture. And in this wiſe, <hi>David</hi> oftentimes both prayed and praiſed, and occaſionally Chriſt in the fleſh both prayed and praiſed, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally did the Apoſtles, and the believing people in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive time both prayer and praiſe. And according to this ſame rule, the Apoſtle bad thoſe that were afflicted pray, and thoſe that were merry, he would have them to praiſe in ſinging of Pſalms, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. And ſo I would have all men (while they be in the body, and the body of ſin in them) to uſe vocal prayer occaſionally, and that their expreſſions may ariſe from the very ſence of the occaſion; and ſuch prayers or expreſſions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires (accompanied with the right ground) God will hear and anſwer the deſires of ſuch, and will deliver them from fear and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118484:44"/>trouble, and then ſhall ſuch have cauſe to praiſe and glorifie him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. But in drawing from example of occaſions wrong concluſions, and ſo making ſet-times, ſuiting to others occaſions, herein you erre greatly, as alſo to draw concluſion from the example of others expreſſions (who ſpake according to the ſence of the occaſion.) For your formal repetitions, this alſo is but fooliſhneſs and fantaſtick conceit, without any ground at all; and long may you call upon your God (even like the Prieſt of <hi>Baal,</hi>) before he grant what you would have; onely this I know you may have granted of God, even as you have framed him a perſon in your fancy, and comprehended him in a place, ſo he anſwereth you again by way of your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by ſuffering the Angel of Light, oftimes beguile you in making you believe you have received a great deal of comfort, and refreſhing in your ſoules from God, when it is no more but the deceiveable ſpirit working in the imagination and fancy.</p>
               <p>I would have inlarged more upon this principle (in your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) but that I would be at ſome other thing, and what is ſaid of this may give you ſome ſight and glimpſe of light, that you thereby may darkly ſee where about you are in this your holy duty of prayer; for in caſe you come to ſee your ſelfe in this particular, you ſhall know aſſuredly that you differ not from the Papiſts themſelves, for this your holy duty of prayer (as you call it) was firſt inſtituted (according to times and formes) amongſt them, and you from them, have borrowed that faſhion of prayer, and you and they are both one in the ſubſtance though you differ in ſome circumſtances in your formes, yet both of you worſhip one and the ſame God in your hearts: But no more of this at preſent.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, I ſpeake a word of another principall ground of your Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> your blinde zeale in being ſo carried out to heare the Ordinances of God as you call them, <hi>viz.</hi> your blinde Prieſts, who have the lying ſpirit of errour in them, by which they have preached to you, and having bewitched you with their Charmes, they have made you beleeve lyes inſtead of truth; and from hence it is that you are altogether out of the way of the truth, both inwardly and outwardly, and yet you have no more knowledge thereof, nor no more ſence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then Witches, whom the Devill have cheated (with his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118484:45"/>deluſions, ſo that they finding, or indeed conceiting, they finde ſuch comfort and content in theſe deluſions, (ſo that they cannot be ſenſible of the danger they be in) even ſo are you cheated by your falſe Prieſts, and have no knowledge at all of the dangerfull deceit you are in, but inſtead of finding out their deceit you are in love with them for their deceiving; but no marvell, for they have offered chanting powder to you, and you have received the ſame of them, and have eaten it in your morſels, and ſo by the vertue (or rather poyſonable nature) thereof, you are made to goe and run ſtarke mad after them, and in this mad zeale you have lived, and doe live in, and in ſo doing you thinke you doe Gods ſervice, and ſeeke to honour him, by attending of his Ordinance. O poore blinde cheated ſoules, I pitty you for your great ignorance herein, for I was in your condition formerly, and I had as great zeale in that way as any of you have, or can have, and I had the ſame thought of duty that you have, yea and I doted in my madneſſe upon theſe your falſe Prieſts, and did very much adore them, I am ſure as much as you can doe, and I owned them as the Ordinances, Oracles, and Miniſters of God; but when the loving kindneſſe of God appeared to me, and that he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make the way of his truth knowne to me, then did I ſee my great folly and madneſſe, and then was manifeſted to me the great deceit of the Prieſts, and more and more, as God was pleaſed to owne me, and teach me; ſo more and more they were diſcovered to me, and out of my love and pitty toward you, as my owne fleſh and blood, I give you warning of them, for they are none of the Miniſters of God, neither ever ſent hee them, but they have been brought into their places by other meanes, as I have ſomewhat ſhewed you before; therefore as all the reſt of your duties, and performances taught you by them, is but by their owne wiſdomes invention, ſo is this alſo; for this duty of hearing them is that which moſt of all exalteth them, for thereby they have both their praiſe, pride, and profit upholden, and that cauſeth them to beat ſo ſore upon that very point, and layeth load upon your poore blinded Conſcience, and by help of the lying ſpirit that is in them, they have wreſted all the Scriptures to, and for their owne purpoſe in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and ſo have blinded you of the right ſence of many places that painted them out in their right colours, and have made
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118484:45"/>uſe of them, and applied them for the upholding of themſelves, and for the oppoſing and putting downe of all who had more appearance of God in them then themſelves; and beſide, when, or where they had, or have power, they took to them the help of the Sword of Juſtice to uphold themſelves, and deſtroy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who had God more clearly manifeſted in them then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thus have they become the Man of Sin, who exalteth himſelfe above God, or any that are called by the name of God, as you ſhall ſee plainly opened afterward; but in the interim beware of them, and thinke not that you performe any accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice to God in going to heare them, for by this very act of yours you become tranſgreſſours againſt God, and ſo he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you up to be deceived, and the way of truth is hid from you.</p>
               <p>But you may object and ſay, In caſe they be not ſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, yet you may heare them, for Chriſt bad the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heare the Scribes and Phariſees which ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chaire, and yet they were ſuch as were againſt Chriſt, and taught the people to obſerve the Law, and yet themſelves obſerved not what they taught to others.</p>
               <p>It is true, Chriſt bad the people obſerve and doe whatſoever the Scribes and Phariſees taught them, but yet he commanded not the people to heare them, but only as you may inferre from the other words; but in caſe he had in plaine words comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to heare them, that maketh not for your hearing of unſent Miniſters in our dayes, as I ſhall plainly prove the ſame unto you. For in theſe laſt dayes both the Law of Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Law of Ceremonies, and the obſervation of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was all in force untill the death of Chriſt in the fleſh, but when he ſpake theſe words he was in the fleſh, and ſo the obſervation of the ceremoniall Law and Circumciſion was tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and to be obſerved of the people; and thoſe Scribes and Phariſees who then ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat, <hi>viz.</hi> to read the Law to the people (and to offer the gifts and ſacrifices, and had the worke of miniſtring in the Temple) they were all of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and were they good men, or bad men that were of that Line, they were to have that office by ſucceſſion, and none other, as you may ſee, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.14. And ſo long as the Law of Ordinances was in force, Chriſt would have them obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe they all were ſhadowes of (and pointed at) him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118484:46"/>and the reading of the Law could not be heard but by the Scribes, who were of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> and as Chriſt was in the fleſh the Law was not ended, neither the ſucceſſion of the Miniſters; and as the ceremoniall Law did hold out Chriſt myſtically, ſo Chriſt bare witneſſe to the truth of the Law ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonially, and what was an Ordinance of God, and that Ordinance being in force that would Chriſt have obſerved, and in this caſe he bad the Lepers goe and ſhew themſelves to the Prieſts, and offer to them what the Law required for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clenſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.14. and in this caſe he cauſed <hi>Peter</hi> to pay tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. and as yet he had not fulfilled the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, for that was fulfilled by his death, but the Ordinance of Circumciſion he had fulfilled in being circumciſed himſelfe, and the Law of the Commandement he had fulfilled in that he had not ſinned, and all thoſe things contained in the Ordinances, he would have all the people to obſerve to the utmoſt, untill the time that all ſhould be fulfilled by his Death, and Reſurrection, and the Prieſts of the Law was ſtill to be heard in reading, and giving out admonitions according to its requiring, as <hi>Moſes</hi> oft times did unto the people in his dayes. But now the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel hath not the ſame calling into the Miniſtery, as we may ſee by Chriſt himſelfe, for he chuſed not any of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to be promulgaters of the Goſpel, neither any great learned men, but a few weake, ſilly, unlettered men, and from that time forward thoſe who were to be Miniſters of the Goſpel had not their calling either by ſucceſſion, or by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Schollerſhip; but thoſe was to be the Miniſters who was called of God, and who had received the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and who had partaken of the Divine nature, by which they had fellowſhip with the Father and the Sonne, and had the Myſteries of God made knowne to them, and manifeſted in them, <hi>And what they had heard and ſeene, that they declared to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.1, 2. and theſe have learned the voyce of Chriſt, and theſe can ſpeake with the voyce of Chriſt, and none other knoweth his voyce, and whoſoever cometh to the Miniſtery otherwiſe they are but Theeves, and there is no ingagement upon any to heare them, but rather to refraine from them. For as for the Scribes, it is evident in Scripture they had their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Prieſthood by Gods owne appointment, and ſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118484:46"/>by his appointment they were to have it by ſucceſſion, whether they were upright men or not, as is aforeſaid; but for your Prieſts they cannot plead ſucceſſion, neither can they ſhew any calling they have at all but what was ordained by men, and ſo they are no more but Miniſters made and ſent out by men; and therefore as they are but the Miniſters of men, you have no command to heare them. And as they want the calling of, and by God, (the which the Scribes and Phariſees had) that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſts doth nothing belong to you, either by command or example, whereby you are at all ingaged to heare thoſe your unſent Prieſts.</p>
               <p>But if any of them can prove it, that God commanded to make Univerſities, and that thoſe whom hee would chuſe to ſpeake in his name (and declare his will and minde unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) ſhould be put ſo many yeares to that Univerſity, and then to be confirmed by a Biſhop, or a Presbytery, and then ſhould they be fit men for his worke; I ſay, if any of them can prove this, though they be never ſo wicked, I would have you to heare them, if they ſpeake any thing that were but like truth; but this I know they cannot prove, and therefore as they have no calling of God, you ought not to heare them, for in hearing them you countenance them, and uphold them contrary to the minde and will of God, and for your rebelling againſt God in this very thing, God bringeth the curſes of theſe your Prieſts upon your ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> the erring from the truth of God, and hereby you are in danger to fall into the ditch with them; and this is like to be all that you ſhall receive of God, for this your pretended zeale, and Ignorant performing of this your holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hearing Gods Miniſters, as you call them.</p>
               <p>I could have run thorow all your holy duties, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances which you obſerve, upon which you have ſtated your religion, and could have proved them of like nature as theſe I have already touched, but I let them paſſe at preſent, and wiſh you to judge the reſt by thoſe that have been ſpoken of, and I make no doubt but you ſhall finde them all but Prieſts precepts, and you may aſſure your ſelves if the fountaine be corrupt, all the ſtreames will prove uncleane.</p>
               <p>And this my Meſſage received from the Lord I here declare, and deliver unto you, and whether you will heare it or not it is nothing to me, ſince I have done what I ought to doe; and in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118484:47"/>caſe they have had the perſecuting hand; but you for want of that caſe that any amongſt you doe beleeve what here is ſaid, and ſo deſireth further knowledge of the way of God, I know you ſhall not want what you deſire; but if any amongſt you ſhall ſlight, or neglect what here is preſented to you, I know the ſame will be as a witneſſe againſt you, and that you ſhall have nothing to plead againſt God for matter of ignorance, ſeeing you had a warning from him of your folly and blindneſſe.</p>

               <head>A word to thoſe who are called Independents.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know if any of you (who are of the Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the <hi>Independant</hi> order) ſhall happen to ſee theſe former lines preſented to the order of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> you will conclude that I have not ſpoken amiſſe in what I have declared to them, both in ſpeaking to their Prieſts, and to the People, for I know many of you have the ſame both in your thoughts, and oft times in your words, and knowing how they are blinded in ſome of their formes, that hath cauſed you to differ and diſſent from them in ſome things, and ſo in thoſe things you differ from them you judge them in feriour to you, and ſo ariſeth ſo many jarres betwixt them and you about your formes, and yet if you knew but the truth as it is in Jeſus (and from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth you became to know your own ſelves) you ſhould not jarre ſo much with them as you doe, for you, and they, and the Papiſts too, are all brethren in the bottome, and all worſhip one and the ſame God with your hearts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Creature, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew you; and you differ not but in your heads, becauſe the God whom your worſhip hath his habitation there, and him you worſhip in your formes; and it is about your formall worſhip you jarre, and whoſoever wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in formes they cannot chuſe but jarre with thoſe who be not in the ſame way of worſhip with them; and from hence it is that ſo much blood becometh ſhed about Religion ſo called,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118484:47"/>and indeed otherwiſe it cannot be, but that while men live in formes they will be jarring, and live in contentions, and the effects thereof is Murther and Blood; but where the power of God, and truth of God is manifeſted, and the heart becometh eſtabliſhed therein, it teacheth men another worke then jarring with, and killing one another, and differing from them in matter of judgement about a few weake out ſid formes, which all is but acts of the creature.</p>
               <p>But be it knowne to you, I have not any intention at all to wrong you, or out of any malice to write to you, but out of a friendly ſpirit give to you that right which doth belong to you in your forme, and would if poſſible let you ſee the emptineſſe in all formes, and would have you to preſſe after that which is the ſubſtance, and life, and bliſſe, and well-being of all ſoules, and this is not comprehended or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in any forme (though never ſo well regulated, and brought into the neareſt conformity that poſſible can be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to rule, or example in Scripture) yet I confeſſe where men live in their weakneſſe and blindneſſe of that which is the chiefe good, and cannot apprehend God as a Spirit, and what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he requireth, nor can know Chriſt in the Divine nature, but according to the Fleſh; ſo long I ſay a forme is tollerable, and men ought to ſtate a forme according to the beſt rule and example in Scripture, and in their time and place they may bee good and uſefull, but out of their time and place they become damageable and hurtfull, <hi>viz.</hi> when they become to bee lived in, and life and peace found in them; and ſo men ſetling down in them, then doe they blinde men of that which is the pure good, and ſo the good (of, and) in theſe formes becometh evill, and this I would have all Formaliſts to take heed of: But more of this you ſhall heare afterward; but now I proceed to the thing intended.</p>
               <p>It is true, I muſt confeſſe your forme is ſomewhat more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and to be approved of in ſome things before thoſe of the Presbyterie order, becauſe you have not as yet been as rigid, and perſecuting of thoſe who have diſſented from your forme, as they have been, but yet as you are but in a forme, you know not what you would doe, in caſe you had but as much power in your hands as the Presbyterians have had in ſome places, for they for theſe many yeares have had power, and by that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118484:48"/>power have been on the ſuffering hand, untill of late, and as yet you are ſenſible of the ſuffering; but in caſe you live to have the whole Nationall power given into your hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become ſtrong, I know then what you would doe, even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute alſo all thoſe who would not worſhip God in your form; but you thinke you would not doe ſo, but I know you would doe ſo; for as you are but in a forme, you would perſecute if you had but the whole power, but thoſe whom you would perſecute moſt would be thoſe who had moſt of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in them; for of all other theſe ſhall be ſure of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for one Formaliſt in ſome reſpect will beare with another, yet all who are but in a forme, of what forme ſoever, will lend a hand to perſecute thoſe who live in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, for what forme is the pureſt is but ſtated according to Chriſt in the fleſh, and all Formaliſts is but the Sons of the bond-woman, and therefore they cannot ceaſe to perſecute the ſons of Freedome; but I know you cannot beleeve that ever you would doe any ſuch wickedneſſe as this, but alas, you know your owne hearts no more then did <hi>Hazaell,</hi> when <hi>Eliſha</hi> told him what miſchiefe he would doe afterward to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 King. 8.13. yet at preſent there is no ſuch thing apparent amongſt you, but God hath uſed you as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby there is more liberty to the free-borne ſons then hath been heretofore, but this freedome as yet is not ſuch to thoſe who are free-borne indeed; but if they come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of your formes, or ſpeake againſt them, they ſhall bee ſure of a ſnap by you if occaſion ſerve for it; but yet I confeſſe this liberty and freedome of yours will give more tolleration to twenty erring Sects, rather then to one who hath the truth of God truly manifeſted in him, in caſe he ſhould come to teach your foundation, but the beſt freedome of ſuch is to keep themſelves unknowne, and then ſhall none have power to hurt them, for indeed for all the liberty of Conſcience that is ſo much ſpoken of, yet if one ſhould appeare to declare the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of godlineſſe, and the great Myſtery of ſin and ſelfneſs in the ſons of men, I am ſure he ſhould not be long without perſecution; but there be ſome amongſt you, yea even of your owne forme, who is growne ſo wiſe in their good thinking, that they conceit, and ſtrongly imagine that Chriſts perſonall reigne is already begun upon the earth, becauſe of ſuch great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118484:48"/>wonders as they ſee brought to paſſe, as they call them, and all is becauſe of the liberty themſelves have gotten to uſe their owne forme with quietneſſe, and this doth ſo ſtrongly worke upon the fancy of ſome wiſe fooles, that from thence they conclude that the Kingdome is given into the hands of the Saints, and that Chriſt ſhal reign amongſt them for a thouſand yeares, and ſo have coted and wreſted many Scriptures to that very purpoſe; but if theſe poor blinded fools had but their eyes opened rightly, they ſhould rather cry out, and bid all the Nation beware, for the Devill is let looſe, and is come downe amongſt them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.12.</p>
               <p>And this I am ſure I can prove, for I can diſcover very much of his working both in religion, and out of religion, not one forme in <hi>England</hi> whatſoever it be but I will prove ſomewhat of the Devill in it; nay, what Office or Trade ſoever is in <hi>England,</hi> even from the higheſt to the loweſt I can ſee the Devill have a hand in it; yea, and in many things a great deale more of him in it then ever; and if this be the beginning of the Perſonall reigne of Chriſt, I marvell what the height of his Kingdome will be; but I could wiſh thoſe poore blinded fooles amongſt you to turne their eyes inward, and looke for the reigning of Chriſt in them, and then I beleeve they ſhall finde ſomething that will hold them doing, that they ſhall looke no more for Chriſt without them; for the reaſon why they are ſo carried out in their fancy is, becauſe they found life in the liberty of their forme, and ſo was carried out from the medling with the evill that is in their owne hearts, and therefore not knowing the Myſterie of ſelfneſſe in them, the Devill hath power to worke in their fancy, and make them looke for ſuch things to be fulfilled outwardly, as ſhall in their time and order be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled inwardly, and all this happeneth becauſe of the forme of godlineſſe without the power of God, and as yet they have not received the truth as it is in Jeſus, neither doe they love the truth, nor can love it, becauſe they doe not know it, and for this cauſe God ſends ſuch very ſtrong deluſions, 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 2.8, 9. But to let theſe paſſe with their fantaſtick conceits, I will ſpeake a word in generall to you, as I finde you ſtated in a form, to which you keep as cloſe in your order as doe the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yea and as hide-bound to your forme as is the Papiſts; and though your forme be ſomewhat more regulated then the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118484:49"/>yet doe you not diſſent from their very forme in moſt things you obſerve, but you ſhake hands with them with the one of your hands, and the other hand you reach out to thoſe of the Anabaptiſts order, and ſo from the Anabaptiſts to you, and from you to the Presbyterians, and ſo from the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians to the Prelatians, and ſo from the Prelatians to the Popes, the collaterall line is kept whole, and you are all tied together with one chaine conſiſting of ſo many linkes, and all of you ſtand in one center, with your feet and your backs one towards another; but as you dance the round you keep the compaſſe, and not ſtep out of it, and you all dance after one Pipe, and can agree to heare its Muſick, for that melody plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you all; and this Muſicioner is the Devill, and his Pipe is the World, with its various notes of profit, pleaſure, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and when this Pipe is ſounded you all dance after it, as though you were all gone mad, and though you all agree in this harmonious dance, yet are you all oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your manners, and breeding, and bringing up, in the courteous conges you make in the ſaluting of him you call your God, and becauſe of this difference you cannot owne one another, though you otherwiſe center all in one.</p>
               <p>Yet you who are of the order of Independency, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe have ſomething amongſt you in your formes which I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and approve of you for it, as you are Formaliſts, and that is, becauſe you have not as yet tied, or conſtrained any to obſerve the ſame way of worſhip with you, but as yet leaveth every one to his owne freedome in way of worſhip, in caſe hee or they be not open blaſphemers, ſo farre all is well. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you are not altogether ſo hide-bound to the unſent Prieſts as the Presbyterians be, though I know you cannot as yet clearly ſee what they are, and therefore you cannot altogether forſake them, and therefore are ſo far in bondage to them; I know likewiſe you have ſome amongſt you called Miniſters, who is of ſomewhat more moderate ſpirited men then thoſe of the Presbyterian order, and that is ſomewhat more inlightned in the knowledge of the truth, according to Chriſt in the fleſh, but yet very few I finde amongſt them who rightly know the truth, as it is in Chriſt according to the Divine nature, yet I muſt confeſſe ſome of them have got a darke notion of the truth in the Divine nature, and yet all endeth but in a better regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118484:49"/>forme, for as for the proper operation of the truth as it is in Chriſt, I have not as yet ſeen any great effects either amongſt you or your Miniſters, for the naturall operation of the truth turneth the heart out of centering in formes, though never ſo well regulated; neither will the power of the truth ſuffer the heart to be carried out to the world, or any created thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but all the feares, cares, loves, and deſires of any thing below God is ſubdued in that ſoule, where the truth hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion in the heart, and little comfort or content can that ſoule have in any thing created or acted, where the truth as it is in Jeſus is rightly knowne, and untill the truth in Jeſus, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Divine nature be received (and from the receiving thereof the knowledge thereof is attained) the heart of men is in bondage either to the creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> the world, with the things contained in it, or elſe the works and acting of the creature, <hi>viz.</hi> formes of Religion of ſome faſhion or other, and all things created, or acted, tendeth to bondage, and men may be in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to either of theſe, or to both, and yet know it not, but thinke themſelves free; and the reaſon is, becauſe they never found bondage in their captivity, but rather freedome; and indeed while man liveth in a forme, he knoweth not the bondage of that forme, but findeth freedome in the forme, yea more freedome then before he tooke the forme upon him; for before he tooke the forme upon him, his Conſcience had power to condemne, but now in the forme blinde Conſcience is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and ſo the heart hath more liberty to center in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things, and yet can pleaſe conſcience with acted things; and thus the worſhip of God is roundly carried on in formes, and the world, and the worſhip thereof goes on as roundly in the heart, and no bondage at all felt in any of theſe things, no more then the <hi>Jewes</hi> who boaſted of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and never were in bondage, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. but the reaſon why bondage is not felt in things acted, and things created is, becauſe the truth of God was never truly known amongſt you, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe you have a zeale, but not according to knowledge, and you have a knowledge, but not according to the truth, for that knowledge you have is but according to Chriſt in the fleſh, and that is but either relative, or artificiall; out of which ariſeth an Hiſtoricall faith, and this pointeth at, and cloſeth with Chriſt as he was in the corporall, or humane nature; and this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118484:50"/>you may have: and indeed none other can you have while you live in formes, and this is not a knowledge in the heart, or a faith in the heart, but this is altogether in the head, and the power of this ſaith will not cloſe with Chriſt, nor can cloſe with Chriſt in the Divine nature, for that faith in the head ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt in the fleſh is alwayes an enemy to Chriſt, as he is in the Divine nature, and the reaſon is, becauſe that the faith according to Chriſt in the fleſh doth not take away luſt out of the heart, but rather conformeth the heart to luſt, and luſt to the heart; and luſt is lovely to the heart, and the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine nature, or faith iſſuing out of (and from) the Divine nature, it killeth luſt in the heart, and draweth the heart with all its affections into the right center; and from hence it is that many in their forms fal ſhort of that which is the true center, and becometh enemies of Chriſt; and yet none preach Chriſt, nor pretend Chriſt more then thoſe; but can you who are ſo compleatly congregated people, thinke that you be any ſuch as be the enemies of Chriſt? I doubt you will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it; but let me tell you in plaine termes, you had beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, leſt you be found in the number of ſuch, for whoſoever are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt ſhall be found enemies to Chriſt; but I feare you doe not rightly underſtand what the Croſſe of Chriſt is, and then how ſhould you be friends to it, for I aſſure you none knoweth the Croſſe of Chriſt but thoſe who be rightly incorporated into the Divine nature, and that is not an incorporating in Kirk-fellowſhip as you call it, and while you are bound up in that incorporating I may upon ſafe grounds conclude, that you as yet know not what the Croſſe ſignifieth.</p>
               <p>But it may be that ſome amongſt you would know what I meane by the Croſſe of Chriſt, and would heare my opinion of the ſame, for I know this is a time wherein man is addicted to heare new things, but yet I have not any new thing to tell you, for what I have to ſay to you is no more but ſuch old tales as hath formerly been told, both by Chriſt and his true follower, but when the following of Chriſt ceaſed, then the old ſayings and tales which was formerly told grew out of faſhion, and new ſayings, and wiſe ſayings, and learned ſayings, and ſtudied fictions, being new, became to be in requeſt. But to anſwer what ſome of you may deſire, I will bring old ſayings to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118484:50"/>the truth hereof to you, and theſe ſhall be the ſaying of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who oft inſiſted upon this very ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> the Croſſe of Chriſt; but this was not the wooden Croſſe upon the which the Body of Chriſt was crucified, that was a type in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the other Croſſe ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the reference the one had to the other, made the Apoſtle uſe that Metaphorical ſpeech (in ſufferings) for ſuffering is this Croſſe, and by ſuffering we have fellowſhip with Chriſt, and beare him company; but what ſuffering is it that maketh man have fellowſhip with Chriſt, and rightly may bee called the Croſſe? it is the daily ſelfe-deniall of our owne hearts with the inclinations, thoughts, loves, and deſires, which is daily tending, and bending downe to the creature in one kinde or other, and the creature with its objects ariſing to meet the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to carry them after them, from the living and abiding in God as he is a Spirit, and in Chriſt as he is in the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the union of the Father, and in that union of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, to keep the heart with its affections, that ſo the fellowſhip of the Father and the Son may daily be the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of our hearts, and this is that which ought to be the center of all hearts, without which there can be no happineſſe in any forme, yea this leadeth the heart out of centering in formes, and this was that which the Apoſtle would have thoſe whom he wrote to, to injoy, and for that end he declared the truth as it was in Jeſus, that ſo they might have fellowſhip with them who were partakers of the truth, and hee affirmeth, that their fellowſhip was with the Father and the Sonne, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.2, 3.</p>
               <p>And where the heart is rightly called, and rightly carried on in the way of Chriſt (and thoſe who were his followers) they reſt not in Formes, and Kirk-fellowſhips, for they finde in themſelves other matters to goe about, and that is to preſſe after the fellowſhip of the Father and the Sonne, and their longing, empty, mourning ſpirit is not, nor cannot be content with any thing below that fellowſhip, and out of the great deſire hereof the ſoule is ſet at varience with all created things, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may interpoſe or keep back the Spirit from that which is the object of its deſire, and when by pure, inlightening the pure beleeving is fixed in the will, or heart, then I beleeve there will be ſuffering in the daily ſtriving to keep the created object from
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118484:51"/>the heart, and the heart from the creature by objects, and then ſhall appeare and be made manifeſt that which never did appeare before, even the great body of ſin and ſelfneſſe, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt be deſtroyed and crucified, and made as dead as the Body of Jeſus, when it hung dead upon the Croſſe of wood, and this daily withſtanding the body of ſin in the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is the Croſſe upon which the body of ſin muſt be crucified; for this body of ſin (or this ſelfneſſe) in the heart muſt dye, or the ſoule muſt dye inſtead of it; and it is not a few daily duties, or being incorporated into a congregated way, that will deſtroy it; no, no, for this body of ſin and ſelfneſſe is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature then ſo, for it will coſt man the beſt blood in him before it be ſubdued; and the Apoſtle who knew the evill of it, and the neceſſity of having it crucified, could not rejoyce in any thing more then in the Croſſe of Chriſt, by which hee was crucified to the world, and the world to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. and by this daily denying of the out-goings of the heart into the creature, (and the incoming of the creature into the heart) man becometh planted into the likeneſſe of Chriſts death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none can be partaker of his reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. and being baptiſed into the death of Chriſt by way of ſuffering in the ſelfe deniall, the body of ſin is deſtroyed, or the old man crucified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. and the Apoſtle counted but all things dung and droſſe in compariſon of knowing Chriſt in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to be found in him, and to know the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſuffering, and a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his death, if by any meanes he might attaine to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10, 11, &amp;c. this was the marke he aymed at, to which he walked by the rule of the ſuffering and example of Chriſt, and in obedience to his commande, (which moſt was for ſelfe deniall) he preſſed hard after him in the way of his ſuffering, that ſo nothing that was of ſelfe might live in him; yea when he found that ſelfe got life and food by way of conſolation, then was he willing to part with conſolation, and choſe to beare Chriſt company in the way of ſuffering, and tooke pleaſure in ſo doing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. But my friends, know you what I meane by what is already ſaid? doe you know what is the Croſſe of Chriſt, and what muſt dye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Croſſe? I hope you may ſtrongly gueſſe at both; but friends, whether are you enemies to this Croſſe yea or nay? if
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118484:51"/>you be friends of the croſſe, then are you the friends of Chriſt, and then are you in fellowſhip with him, either in ſuffering with him, or in reigning with him; if in ſuffering with him, then doe you obey his commands in taking upon you the Croſſe, and following him to the death of the Croſſe; and if it be ſo that you have communion with him in this way, then I know your mindes is rent from, or in renting from all created things whatſoever, no profit or gaine in the world is deſired, nay the very thoughts of it is terrible to you; and in caſe it ſometimes dare approach to tempt, yet are you as quick in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and beating downe theſe thoughts, and then the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy praiſe of men is loathſome to you, and little doe you care for any approbation of any whatſoever; and then pleaſures of the ſences, and the affections with, or in any thing created or acted is not at all regarded; loſſe of friends, and increaſing of foes is all one thing, yea love of friends, and hatred of foes is all one; rich and poore are all one, loſſe or gaine all one, good report and bad report all one, duty performed our unperformed all one, congregated or uncongregated all one, and whatſoever in their name and nature may differ is all one; for why, God is but one and all, and as man is in God by earneſt of deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> by being oned with Chriſt by way of ſuffering, the will of man becometh tranſplanted out of varieties, and differing of things into the one and only wil of the Father; and this was that which Chriſt himſelfe in the fleſh aymed at, and was compleated in him, even onedneſſe of will, and well-pleaſedneſſe with ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and if you know the Croſſe of Chriſt, and have taken it up, then are you his Diſciples, and then he teacheth you to forſake your ſelves in all things. But I ſomewhat feare that you follow not Chriſt in this way, no not ſo much as in an outward conformity, for I doubt that ſuperfluities of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is not as yet forſaken of you, much leſſe the body of ſinne in the inward man in crucifying, for I can beleeve you have learned Chriſt in another way then in following him by ſuffering, by which the body of ſin is to be deſtroyed, for that way you have learned is to beleeve in Chriſt, and apply his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and not to follow his ſuffering, yea &amp; that is a very cunning eaſie way, for by that way you can cloſe with Chriſt in what he ſuffered himſelfe, and by an Hiſtoricall faith can beleeve that what he ſuffered was for you, and by that falſe faith can apply
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118484:52"/>Chriſt in the way of propitiation, and yet forſake him in the way of imitation, and I promiſe you this is a handſome way if it were a ſure way, for hereby God and the world, Chriſt and the body of ſinne might ſtand all in one ſoule, and I wiſh you were not couſened in this very point; and I aſſure you, that if you have not followed Chriſt in the way of the croſſe, in the daily denying of your ſelves both inwardly and outwardly (by that faith you have gotten, whereby you apply Chriſt in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings) you will be beguiled one day, for that faith is but that which draweth you into duty, and Kirk-fellowſhip, and not into the fellowſhip of Chriſt, and herein you may prove the enemies both of Chriſt and his Croſſe; but let me call to your remembrance another old ſaying out of date, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe out of requeſt, and ſo but little heeded, and yet it ſhall be one of his who was a follower of Chriſt in the way of the Croſſe, and this was <hi>Pauls,</hi> and let us ſee and judge by it who are the enemies of the Croſſe; and when he gave out the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he gave it out with weeping teares, for though hee had preached Chriſt crucified ſo much, and himſelfe walked by the ſame example, preſſing forward to the price of the high calling, <hi>viz.</hi> by bearing the croſſe of Self-deniall, and ſo bearing Chriſt company, having fellowſhip with him in his ſuffering, by which he was to have the body of ſinne and ſelfneſſe deſtroyed, that thereby he might live in the lovely fellowſhip of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, and this he aimed at, and wiſhed thoſe who were of the ſame ſpirit with him, that they ſhould all minde the ſame thing, and walke by the ſame rule, and follow him as hee followed Chriſt, and then in pitty and tender-heartedneſſe, and weeping, he tels them of thoſe who were the enemies of the croſſe, and painteth them out in their right colour, and giveth them their portions, in the firſt place ſetting the effect before the cauſe, <hi>vid.</hi> deſtruction, and then ſetteth a three-fold chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter upon them, as the cauſe of their deſtruction, viz. <hi>Whoſe belly is their god, who glory in their ſhame, who minde earthly things, Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. This is an old ſaying little heeded, but mark it well, for here I call it to a new remembrance, I hope God is what he was then, Chriſt is now what he was then, the Croſſe is now what it was then, the enemies of the Croſſe is ſuch now as was then, the effect is ſuch now as was then; therefore my friends of the congregated order, judge your ſelves by theſe three
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118484:52"/>characters, whether you be enemies or friends of the croſſe yea or nay: but it may be you hardly know how to judge your ſelves by them, therefore for your ſakes I will explaine them a little, that thereby you may the better judge your ſelves by them; but I will be ſhort, and not tedious in explaining, that you may be the more capable to underſtand; then mark the firſt character, viz. <hi>Whoſe belly is their god, &amp;c.</hi> This may ſeeme an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſaying, and they were ſore beſotted and fooliſh, who made a god of their belly; and it ſeemes ſuch a fooliſh thing to doe ſo, that few can conceive that they themſelves doe any ſuch thing; but in caſe there be any ſuch who doe that fooliſh act, yet every one can excuſe himſelfe, and think it may belong to ſome other, but marke well what ſhall be ſaid, and ſee which of you can excuſe himſelfe when the truth of the ſaying is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Well, what is God? he is the chiefe delight, and chiefe treaſure, and thoſe that knoweth him doth chuſe him ſo, and he is their chiefe delight, and chiefe treaſure, and ſo their hearts is with him, and all its affections, in ſeeking, loving, fearing, and deſiring, &amp;c. and to witneſſe this truth our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Where your treaſure is there will your hearts be alſo;</hi> and the heart can no way be diſcovered but by its effects, <hi>viz.</hi> inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoughts, feares, cares, loves, and deſires, &amp;c. then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether God, or your bellies be your god, or chief treaſure, and whether you owne and worſhip more with your hearts, and your affections; if God be your God, and chiefe treaſure, then your hearts with its affections is in him, and with him all the day long, and is worſhipping him either in prayer, or praiſes, and all your thoughts taken up with things of the ſame nature, and things of the world is but a great vexation to your ſpirits, and you looke but upon them, but as they ſerve for your meere neceſſity, and though it be meere neceſſity (in reſpect of your fraile bodies) yet even to have your thoughts drawne out of God, if never ſo little, yet this is a detriment and trouble to your ſpirit, becauſe theſe thoughts doe ſomewhat pierce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and your God, ſo that your whole converſation cannot be in Heaven, this I know will bee no little trouble to you if God be your God; and the Apoſtle who worſhipped God, and had choſen him to be the chiefe treaſure, ſaid, that both he and his upright followers had their converſation in heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. and thoſe to whom he had preached Chriſt,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118484:53"/>and his croſſe, and the riſing againe with him (leſt they ſhould learne the ſame by comprehenſion, and relative beleeving) hee giveth them a caveat in a negative ſpeech, to which he added an affirmative command, and ſaid, <hi>If yee be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>ſet your affections on things above,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. and God giveth out his command to love him with the whole heart; and <hi>Moſes</hi> in declaring Gods command to the people, delivereth the ſame to them in like manner, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and thou ſhalt cleave to him,</hi> Deut. 10.20. which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth that there would be ſomething that would draw, and pull the heart from God, for he knew the body of ſinne would be ſtirring, and the creature would be creeping into their hearts, by which they ſhould be in danger to be pulled from the true God, and therefore he bid them cleave to him; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle who had choſen God for his God, and knew the ſubtlety of the body of Sin and ſelfe, he was cautelous of the ſame, and kept manfully to the warfare between the creature and the heart, whereby whatſoever ſought to interpoſe between God and his heart, that he beat down, yea if it were but in a thought, or in an imagination, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. and in ſo doing every thought was brought into the obedience of Chriſt, and this was by bearing the croſſe under which hee rejoyced, and ſo became the friend and companion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If you can witneſſe to this in your owne ſpirits, and your hearts have choſen God for your God, and that your daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe be in God, and your heart with its affections be thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, then God is your God indeed, and you are the friends of Chriſt, and his Croſſe, otherwiſe take it for granted, you are of thoſe whoſe belly is their god: for the belly hath a large ſignification if I would but touch upon every particular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet I omit the moſt of what may be ſaid thereof, and will only give you a ſhort touch thereof; as for the belly, it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſuming, unſatiable, requiring more then is meet for it, and moſt of the Sences is as ſervants to it, and doth uſurp upon the affections to ſerve it alſo, and where it is the god, it doth command obedience to its requirings, and ſo the affections in obedience doth invent deſire, and ſeeke what may be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to and for its requirings, and ſo the affections (by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they have with the Sences, and the command over
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118484:53"/>them) doth cauſe them to help on this worke, and through the commanding power of both, the other members of the body is carried on to act in that obedience alſo; and thus is the whole man in action about the ſervice of the Belly, and ſo man is made to invent, thinke, and deſire, and act about thoſe things which is created for ſatisfying the Belly: from hence it is that the belly being the chief god, that all theſe ſuperfluities is provided for it, and ſo many ſeverall diſhes, when one of them would ſerve Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and for upholding the worſhip of this god, what care, feare, and deſire, labour, and watching, and waiting, yea ſome for the worſhip and ſervice they owe to this god, ſacrifice all their whole eſtate, and ſome for this ſervice will oppreſſe their fellow creatures, and ſome for this ſervice labour day and night, both in body and minde, and all little enough to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this hungry god, and whatſoever belongeth to the backe hath a relation to the belly, and theſe two agree in one in their requirings, as they become god, and ſo (to and) for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip through the commanding power of luſt, put in action all the affections, ſences, and members of the body and ſoule; and ſo it is, that ſo many fooliſh fantaſtick faſhions, and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits becometh worne in theſe dayes, ſo that I much feare this god hath great power, and is much worſhipped in our time, yea more then heretofore.</p>
               <p>And as men have power in their hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the riches of this world, they become the greater providers for this gods ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and then they become to have the ſecond character ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, viz. <hi>They glory in their ſhame;</hi> is not this to be ſeen in our dayes amongſt moſt ſorts of thoſe we call Profeſſors, how they are carried out to worſhip Back and Belly, as is before ſaid, but eſpecially amongſt thoſe who be rich in the world, having ſuch ſumptuous and exceſſive tables, and all things ſuitable, for the upholding of the luſt of the eye, &amp; yet doe they not ſee very many of their fellow creatures like to ſtarve, both for meat and cloathing, and yet they can look upon them with a light look, and very little compaſſion, and the reaſon is, that which they have they muſt keep for ſacrifices for their god, and the reſt they muſt keep for themſelves to glory in, for the very ſight of rich ſuperfluities lifteth up the heart, and the thoughts thereof doth yeeld them comfort, and the having and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe things winneth the praiſe of ſuch fooles as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118484:54"/>and in all theſe they glory, and yet all they glory in is but their ſhame, yea and abominable ſhame too, both in the eyes of God, and in the eyes of thoſe who are weaned from ſuch things, and by the Croſſe have crucified theſe things; Is it not a ſhame to have the creatures of God in abundance, and ſo many like to ſtarve for want? and yet the bowels of compaſſion ſhut up againſt them, how dwelleth the love of God in ſuch? and in the having of theſe things doe they not puffe up the Perſons that have them, above their fellow creatures? and ſo reſpecteth perſons, and accounteth much of ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and deſpiſe thoſe who be inferiour to them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.3. is not this a ſhame, and yet how many doth glory herein? Nay, how many various pleaſures and delights is there that men glory in, and yet a ſhame to be taken up with them? How many ſhamefull gloryings belongeth to thoſe who are the enemies of the Croſſe, who have their belly for their God? but I let them paſſe, and come to the third character, <hi>viz. Who minde earthly things;</hi> Its love to that which is the god hath the minde, and no marvell if the Belly be the god, if the minde be ſet on earthly things; and this is that which will try all ſoules whether they have God, or their belly for their god; for though the belly cannot devour all in the worſhipping of it, yet that which is not offered in ſacrifice to it, that becomes to be gloried in; and for upholding that worſhip, and that glory, the minde muſt of neceſſity be carried out to meddle about earthly things, for it is theſe that muſt uphold all the glory, and the worſhip of that god, and though the glory, and the worſhip of that god be the beſt performed by, and of thoſe who are rich, yet thoſe who are not ſo great and rich in the things of the world, I make no doubt but their wills is as bent to worſhip that god, and to glory after that manner, and its poſſible the will may be acceptable for the deed, and where the will is led out in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thoſe things, I am ſure the minde is ſet about earthly things; for where there is any god (but the true God) either in poſſeſſion, or in deſire, the minde will be conſtantly carried out about that which will pleaſe their god, and two Gods no man can ſerve, for he will love the one, and hate the other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. and thoſe who would owne the true God for their God, was not to have their minds ſet, or carried out to ſeek any thing below him, no not ſo much as to have a thought of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118484:54"/>what ſhould be the next day; and all that any ſhould look for in this world, is no more then needfull food and raiment, and this muſt not be had with either fearing, caring, or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but by way of beleeving, and the minde wholly carried out in ſeeking the Kingdome of God, and the righteouſneſſe thereof; theſe are old worne-out ſayings of Chriſt, and they being worne out of date with oldneſſe, they are but little hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for we have got a new way to the Kingdome of God, by which we can carry the world, and the body of ſin and Selfneſs, and duty, and all together, and this way is by the falſe faith framed by the braine knowledge of the learned Prieſts, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have invented ſuch a fine way, how can fooles but love them, and thinke themſelves happy if they can but get incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into their congregations; but weigh what is hinted at before, and ſee who are the enemies of the Croſſe, and I beleeve you ſhall finde no want of ſuch in your congregations; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I doe not marvell that the Croſſe hath ſo many enemies, ſeeing the vertue of it would take away ſin, and deſtroy Selfe, and men loving Selfe ſo well, they cannot abide to goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without it, and this new-found way leadeth to heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, in which Selfe and all goeth together.</p>
               <p>My friends, who are of the Independant congregations, conſider with your ſelves whether or no you be the enemies of the Croſſe or not, &amp; do not ſo much pretend Chriſt, and talk of Chriſt with your tongues, and yet be enemies to his Croſſe in your hearts; I know what I ſpeake, and have ſome grounds for what I ſay, I know where you ſtand, and what is your worſhip well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and I have juſt cauſe to feare that many in your congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations be more enemies then friends to the Croſſe, but I am partly perſwaded that your ignorance is ſome cauſe thereof, and the cauſe of your ignorance is by reaſon of many of your Miniſters, for I know you have abundance of them who are of the falſe-hearted crue, who through cunning of their wit have played the Juglers, and ſeeing your order come into requeſt, and like to carry the ſway in theſe times, and fearing to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers by ſuch alterations, through their cunning have transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves into another ſhape, and ſo have crept in amongſt you; and though they ſeeme to be ſomething, yet they are but the ſame they were before in their heart; and I know they have power by the great hand of their God, who firſt made them Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118484:55"/>to Metamorphize themſelves into any likeneſſe, but beware of them, for they will keep you ſtill in ignorance, and by diſſembling deceive you; for they are many of them the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, yea, and have wreſted the minde of God in the Scriptures, contrary to what he aimed it for, and have made uſe of it for their own back ends, and have taught the people contrary to the truth; and ſo have kept them in ignorance until this day, and by their means the knowledge of the Croſs hath ceaſed theſe many years, and ſo there hath been the falling away from the knowledge of the truth: And this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw clearly in his time, and told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the day of Chriſt ſhould not come before ſuch a fall, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>I would have given you a full deſcription of the enſuing myſtery in this Chapter, but that I would not be too tedious to you, nor too much offenſive to the order of Prieſts; for I aſſure them, they are mightily included in it, and the true opening of it would vex them all to the very heart, and what I have already written to them, ſhall ſuffice at preſent; but in caſe I be called to write again, I profeſs whatſoever the Lord ſhall make known to me, on their behalf, ſhall undoubtedly be uttered, though at preſent I have prevailed to forbear.</p>
               <p>And you my Friends, who are of the congregated order of what parts ſoever, whether more in knowledge, or leſs in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, this I deſire of you, To aim to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, and preſſe hard after him who is gone before, who left us all an example of ſuffering; and be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled with a pretence of love of Chriſt, and union with Chriſt, before you have born his Croſs, by which the body of ſin in you becometh crucified; and that the things created, and things acted, have loſt their power, ſo that your ſpirits is not in bondage to any of them; for I aſſure you ſo long as the body of ſin and ſelfneſs is uncrucified in you, you ſhall not enjoy much of the fellowſhip of the Father and the Son, pretend what you will.

Then you who are my Friends of mine own fleſh and blood, who have betaken your ſelves into the Form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſing, and ſo conceive your ſelves the onely people of God, becauſe of your well regulated form, and you do ſo Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize your form, that you conclude, that of neceſſity men muſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118484:56"/>be brought into your form, before they can have fellowſhip, and communion with Chriſt; and that all experience is nothing but deluſion, if it be not attained to under your form. How now friends, know you where you are, or into what Region you are flown, in your high, and well fledg'd conceits? are you in the firſt, ſecond, or third Heaven, or mounted unto the top of ſome high ſpired ſteeple, and ſo from thence you look down, and ſee all men below you, ſeeming but as little children in compariſon of your ſelves; but yet take heed to your ſelves, for thoſe that you ſee walking below you, though they may ſeem inferior to you, yet you know not but they both ſtand, and walk as ſafely as you; for it is poſſible while you are looking down at others, and judging them for their being ſo below you (and ſeeming ſo little in compariſon of your ſelves,) that your ſelves may catch a fall, from your high mounted, or conceited ſteeple, yea, ſuch a fall as will lay you level with the ground: I wiſh it were not lower.</p>
               <p>Is this your Form, the Gate through which all muſt enter that go to Heaven? I am ſure you conclude no leſs; but if your concluſions could be proved true, it were a very eaſie door to enter in at: But what ever you may conclude of your Form, I am right ſure, that both you and all other ſhall paſs through a ſtraighter gate then your form, before ever they ſhall enter the Kingdom of God. I know you finde, or rather think you finde freedom and liberty in your Form, and ſo would engage others to be partakers of the ſame with you; yet while you think you have liberty, and preach, and pretend the ſame to others, I can prove that you your ſelves are the ſervants of ſin, <hi>John</hi> 8.34.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, for that which you obſerve as a main principle in your form, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, is near the rule of Scripture, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Types was inſtituted in time of Scripture; and therefore for the uſing of it after your own order, I leave it to your own freedom; but yet I would have you to know, that if your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be not carried out of, and beyond it, into the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; you ſhall all periſh in your form, and your form it ſelf ſhall periſh, as ſhall all other forms of what kinde ſoever; and ſo ſhall all things acted, ordained, or created, all ſhall periſh; for they were begun with time, and in time, and time it ſelf ſhall wear them out, and time it ſelf ſhall periſh alſo: then in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118484:56"/>what or where ſhall the ſpirits of men be happy and finde reſt? therefore I ſay, wo to thoſe ſouls who live in, and contend for any thing that hath its being in time, though it be never ſo pure an Ordinance; for all things ordained, acted, or created, was provided to bring the ſpirits of men out of theſe things, into that which cannot be comprehended in time, neither is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or created.</p>
               <p>And all Forms muſt, and ſhall be ſwallowed up in that which is no form, according as we underſtand forms, and all created things ſhall be ſwallowed up in that which is uncreated, and all actions ſhall be ſwallowed up in that which never acted, as we act, nor as we underſtand acting; but I will not flie too high from that I would be at, for my intention is not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with things too hard for your underſtanding, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to your own capacity, and ſpeak a word with a tongue which you may well underſtand, in caſe your form have not ſtopt your ears, and made blinde your eyes, and made groſs your hearts, that ſo you can neither hear, ſee, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>Well, now to the thing intended, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſpeak a word of that which is your main principle point in your Form, and that is Baptiſm. I know what ground you have for this act, <hi>viz.</hi> From example of the primitive time, as alſo in obedience to the commands of Chriſt. Its true indeed, Chriſt gave out ſuch a command to his Diſciples, as he did for the obſerving of the Type inſtituted at his laſt Supper, of which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſomething formerly: But my friends, do you know what was the minde of Chriſt, in giving out command for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation? If you do ſay, you know his minde, I ſay you walk not according to what you ſay you know, as will appear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in ſpeaking more fully hereof; but in caſe you know not the minde of Chriſt in this command, then take it for granted, you cannot yield right obedience to Chriſt in your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of this command; but in your obedience in the ſame, you detract from Chriſt, and ſo become his enemies, in this your obedience.</p>
               <p>I have ſomething touched this Type of Baptiſm before, yet here I proceed a little further in illuſtrating the ſame more fully.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I would have you to obſerve that Baptiſm

Now the threefold Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, and their times, places, operations, and effects had relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and did accord to the witneſſing of the threefold names, with their times, places, operations, and effects; and theſe threefold Baptiſms according to the threefold names in their times, places, operations, and effects, all tended to one and the ſame end, <hi>viz.</hi> To draw the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> into that which is the choice and cheif good, out of all things acted or created, which all have but a ſeeming good in them, as ſhall be made appear in ſpeaking of them in order.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe Baptiſms, it was but a dark Type, under which the firſt name Father became to be made known to the people in that time, under that diſpenſation; and in thoſe days the threefold Name was not ſo much as heard of, but the threefold Name was all included in one Name, and that was <hi>I am, Exod.</hi> 3. whereby is to be underſtood the whole Deity undivided, or the perfection of the Godhead, undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable in the eſſentiality of its Being, and that nothing was, but as it had an appearance of its Being in that which was the ſubſtantial Being it ſelf: and this <hi>I am,</hi> or undividable Deity, or ſubſtantial Being, in our language we call God; and ſo when God would have himſelf further known and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to the ſons of men (then formerly) he ſelected out of many, ſome few to know and own him as the onely God, ſo that his Name might be ſpread abroad in all the world, by the great wonders which he would do for them.</p>
               <p>In which time, upon the requeſt of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God giveth out a more large ſignification of his name, as followeth, <hi>The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, abounding in goodneſs and truth. Keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving tranſgreſsions, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſin. And will in no wiſe clear the guilty, &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 34 6, 7. Now all theſe are the Name or names of God, beſide other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names he putteth out himſelf by, according as time and occaſion made way, for the declaring of his Name further to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118484:57"/>the Sons of men, and ſo upon the time of the puniſhing men for ſin, he hath the name Juſtice; and from the diſpleaſure he hath at man for ſin, ſo is his name anger, and as he hath a continuall watching and ſeeming eye towards thoſe whom he would have to continue in his love, he hath the name of <hi>Jealous,</hi> and according to his maryellous workes he hath the name of <hi>Wonderfull,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo it is, that according to the preſent work, and preſent occaſion, ſo is his name, whether in his love, or in his anger. So when he would have his name knowne (or the Sons of Men to know him by his name) and ſo to owne him for their God, he made himſelfe knowne to them in outward acts, and wondrous workes, which he ſhewed to them in the delivering them out of the bondage of <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſo brought them by a ſtrong hand out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> through the great Sea, guiding them by the Angel of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the cloudy pillar, &amp;c. at which time the firſt Baptiſme had its beginning, though not in name, yet in its nature, and ſo the Apoſtle told the <hi>Corinthians, That he would not have them to be ignorant, how that all the fathers paſſed through the ſea, and were under the cloud, and were all baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the cloud, and in the ſea,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.1, 2. and the reaſon why he calleth that work by the name of Baptiſme is, becauſe of the nature of the work, and ſo in the time of the Goſpel, when Baptiſme had the name put upon the act, it was derived from the nature of the act, and though the formes in theſe three Baptiſmes differ in reſpect of time, yet all of them have that name in reſpect of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the nature of Baptiſme in its operation in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſignification, is a departing from one thing and cloſing with another, or the dying to one thing, and the living to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; or the conſuming of one thing, and the eſtabliſhing of another, in all which ſuffering is included, as you ſhall ſee hereafter; now the people who underwent the firſt Baptiſme, by it they were preſerved from the danger of their enemies, and in the terrible worke of this Baptiſme the people was in great feare of being deſtroyed by their enemies, becauſe they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the ſervice of them; but when they had fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone this Baptiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> through the red Sea, and came ſafe unto the other ſide, then were they glad, and beleeved in the Lord, who had manifeſted his name unto them, and was then obedient unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and was willing to be led by him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118484:58"/>ſhortly to be conveyed into the Land of promiſe, &amp;c. and in this reſpect the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>They were all baptiſed into</hi> Moſes, <hi>viz.</hi> they were brought out, or made to depart and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and by the terrible Wonders of God in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting of his name, brought through the Sea, and made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to yeeld obedience unto the Word and Commands of God, delivered to them by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and in further manifeſting of his name appeared to them in a terrible manner upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and gave out the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was to declare the ſame unto the people, and the people was to be obedient unto that Law, and unto all other Ceremoniall types that then was to be delivered unto them; in all which was contained the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Workes, and in all the time of the Moſaicall Law, or firſt Covenant of workes, there was no other but the name of God, to bee knowne amongſt men; neither any other name by which men were to be ſaved, for then the God-head was whole, and undivided into the two other names, <hi>viz.</hi> Son, and Holy Ghoſt (as was afterward) yet all the vertuall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the other two was included in the firſt name or names of God, and was the ſame then which they be now, and in the vertuall communion there was never any diviſion at all, but as diſpenſations had their proper place, ſo God put out himſelfe into diſtinct properties, according as hee would have the Sonnes of Men to have a more cleare manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And ſo it was, that from the time that the Fathers were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as is ſomewhat ſaid before, all their ſucceeding children was to be taught the knowledge of the wonderous work which he hath done, where he firſt made his name knowne to them, and was to owne no other name, but the name of that God, and ſo taught all his Lawes and precepts to them, that they ſhould walke in obedience to the requirings of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And in all the time of the diſpenſation under the Law the whole Deity was named by the name of God, or Father; but when the fulneſſe of time was come, that God would appeare in a diſpenſation more cleare, by which the Sonnes of men might the better know him, then it was that the God-head in its properties divided it ſelfe, and united it ſelfe to Fleſh, and ſo became the diſtinction in the God-head, but yet the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was the ſame it was before in the unity, and in this new
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118484:58"/>diſpenſation; <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> begun the ſecond Baptiſm, in which he bare witneſſe to the truth of the diſtinct property (of God the Father) <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, or the Son of God, and that hee was the Lamb of God which tooke away the ſins of the world, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.29. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Meſſenger of God, ſent by him, to declare his whole name, (or the whole God-head in his name) unto the people, when he would deliver them out of the Aegyptians bondage in the time of the firſt Baptiſme; ſo <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was his ſecond Meſſenger, ſent by him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and beare witneſſe of the diſtinct property of God, and to ſhew to the people the name and worke of God in that diſtinct property, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt the Son of God. And as God did appeare more neare to manifeſt himſelfe to men in his Son, ſo the office of <hi>Iohn</hi> was to bring men out of, and from under that darke diſpenſation under the Moſaicall obſervations, into a more neare conformity, and cleare beholding of God, in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſpenſation under the Sonne; and for this very purpoſe both the preaching and acting of <hi>Iohn</hi> tended, to which God himſelfe gave teſtimony alſo in the act of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſme, by the appearance of another of his diſtinct properties, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and from hence it was that the name of the Sonne was added to the name of the Father; and as the whole God-head ſtood in one name in the former diſpenſation, and in making that name knowne, and in giving out Lawes and Ordinances to be obſerved in that name, in which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of workes was in force; that name was terrible, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the people could not abide to heare God ſpeake to them; yea <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe feared that great Majeſty, and quaked exceedingly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. But when the God-head had in its property divided it ſelf into the ſecond diſpenſation, into the property of Chriſt, and ſo the ſecond name of the Sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be declared, that name was Love, and Peace, and God with us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. or God well pleaſed, and reconciled to us. And the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> it was called the Baptiſme of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24. in which is included ſorrow, and departing, or forſaking of ſomething, or a dying to ſomething; and to cloſe with, or to live in another thing, and that was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking, or dying, or departing from the former obſervations wherein they lived under the firſt Covenant of workes, and to cloſe with, and live to the ſecond appearance of God in that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118484:59"/>preſent diſpenſation wherein he would ſhew himſelfe in a more quiet and peaceable manner then he had ſhewed himſelfe in the former.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John,</hi> who made the way for, and pointed at Chriſt as he was in the fleſh, he likewiſe bare witneſſe of, and fore-told what Chriſt would doe in the ſpirit, <hi>viz. Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 3.11. and the beginning of this Baptiſme was after the death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion of Chriſt, as may be ſeen in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2, 3, &amp;c. now this third Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was more excellent then the two former, and this was the Baptiſme of Chriſt, by the out-pouring of the Holy Ghoſt, and the worke and operation of this Baptiſme is to burne up, conſume, or deſtroy all the remainder of what was left by the other two former Baptiſmes, and likewiſe to comfort and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh, and make to live in a more ſafe and ſure union of the thing cloſed with; and from hence the third name is added to the two former, and thus the whole God-head in its properties divided it ſelfe into the three names, <hi>viz.</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and in theſe three names, or into theſe three names was all perſons to be Baptiſed, and Chriſt gave out his command to the very ſame purpoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.</p>
               <p>And as theſe three-fold Baptiſmes did accord with the three-fold names in time, operation, and effect, in the outward manifeſtation in order, one following or ſucceeding another; ſo they held out, or typified the inward and ſpiritual ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and this inward worke and effect of theſe three names, and Baptiſmes, is that whereby and wherein the life and happineſſe of all ſoules conſiſt, in having the ſame compleatly fulfilled in them. And as I have given a little hint of the outward names, and Baptiſms, in their times and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, ſucceeding one another, ſo I proceed to ſpeake a word of that which is the chiefe worke, effect, and end of all theſe in their inward or ſpirituall order of ſucceeding.</p>
               <p>Therefore obſerve the Myſtery of the firſt Baptiſme, or the Baptizing into the firſt name (Father) in the firſt diſpenſation under the Law, as God in his orderly proceeding calleth, and manifeſteth himſelfe to us.</p>
               <p>Now when the Lord God would deliver the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from under the bondage of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and to make his name knowne to the people, as the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118484:59"/>whole Deity ſtood in the one name, ſo his name was made known to them in a wonderful and terrible manner, as is before ſaid. So it is with us, when God beginneth to draw our ſoules out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> bondage, <hi>viz.</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or groſſe actings, in which the Devill and our Luſts have kept us in bondage, amongſt the ſonnes of men in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition living in the world; and this God doth by the manifeſting of his great and terrible name in the firſt worke of the ſoule, whereby the ſoule becometh rouſed up, and made to ſtirre, and look about it ſelfe, and to conſider in what bondage it is, by being ſo groſly carried out into the diſobedience of the requirings of the commands of God; and from hence it is that God appeareth in the terribleneſſe of the condemning property of the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſcience, and maketh his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes, aad wrathfull diſpleaſure knowne in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible parts of man, which keepeth the ſpirit in under its captivity, and this God doth by the hand of his ſervant <hi>Moſes, viz.</hi> by ſending the Law of Commandment out, and ſetting it home to the heart, and yet how loath is the Devill (who hath his Kingdome in the inferiour parts of the ſoule) to let the ſpirit of man goe out of his captivity, from ſerving him and his people, <hi>viz.</hi> groſſe ſins, and outward tranſgreſſions, and from eating of his Onions and Garlick, <hi>viz.</hi> in having complacence in thoſe ſins, and the love of the fellowſhip of the men of the world, and eating of their dainties, <hi>viz.</hi> pleaſures of all ſorts, which concernes the ſatisfying the corruptible part in man; but when God goeth on in his wondrous workes, and ſhewed upon <hi>Pharoah,</hi> viz. The Devill and his people, then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> is made willing to depart, <hi>viz.</hi> the noble faculties of the ſoule and affections from thence proceeding, and when the firſt borne becometh ſlaine, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtrength of the will begotten in it by the Devill, then the Devill is forced to let the noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty depart from the bondage of the Luſts beforeſaid; then out they goe to the red Sea, whereat the people was in greater ſtrait then ever, <hi>viz.</hi> though the noble properties and the will be going, and departing out of the bondage beforeſaid, yet the Devill raiſeth up all his forces, and purſueth the noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoule, thinking to take them againe into bondage in that ſtrait at the red Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> when the noble faculties is in departing out of ſin, then it is that temptation is more raiſed up
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118484:60"/>then ever, and doth ſo heap up, and flow before the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that to paſſe over them there is no hope or likelihood to reaſon, in which ſtrait the Devill with his army driveth on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace in the Iraſcible faculties, and cometh on the back ſide of the noble faculties of the ſoule, and ſo raiſeth deſpaire and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret feare, out of which anger and paſſion is produced, and in the operation of which, in that great diſtreſſe of the ſoul, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe, that it had never ſtirred out of its former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then to have moved thus farre, and to be ſwallowed up in that preſent ſad condition.</p>
               <p>But when God will have his name more clearly manifeſted, then doth he divide the Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> all theſe great over-flowings of temptations, and ſo the noble faculties and the ſpirit paſſeth through them all, and the Devill, and ſin, and deſpaire, is all over-whelmed in thoſe temptations, and this is the great work of God in the defeating of the Devill, and deſtroying him and ſin in the ſame way, wherein he thinketh to deſtroy the noble faculties of the ſoule; and when the noble faculties becometh thus delivered, having undergone this firſt Baptiſme, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or plunging as before ſaid, then doth man begin to feare the name of that great God, who hath done theſe great things for his ſoule, and ſo becometh to be obedient to <hi>Moſes,</hi> viz. to the outward requiring of the Commandment, and knowing God to be ſo great and terrible, the feare of his name doth cauſe man to yeeld obedience to his Law, and in the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or going aſtray from its requirings, the ſame appearance of God is manifeſted, as was at the giving out thereof, and this terribleneſſe of God is knowne in the condemning part of the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſcience, and ſo in the obedience to God in his terrible manifeſtation in the firſt Baptiſme, under the firſt diſpenſation, man acteth in that feare to all the outward requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the letter, and ſeeketh thereby to aſſwage and allay the appearance of that anger, and goeth about to pleaſe God, and ſatisſie Juſtice by outward ſacrifices, and ſo it is that man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under this diſpenſation, and acting zealouſly therein, the condemning part or conſcience becometh ſomewhat pacified, and quietneſſe beginneth to appeare; and from hence it is that men draw concluſions, that God is well pleaſed with their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; and as under this firſt Baptiſme in the firſt diſpenſation (wherein is contained the firſt Covenant of workes) men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118484:60"/>God in terror, in the manifeſting the whole Deity in the one Name, they become to yeeld obedience accordingly, <hi>viz.</hi> in a fearful ſervile manner, like flint ſtone and the ſteel, who being forcibly beat together, from which fire is produced, even ſo the heart of man in the firſt diſpenſation is hard as the nether milſtone, and will not yeeld any obedience, except the hand of God by the Hammer of the Law ſmite upon the ſame, and thereby force out obedience, to what God requireth in the firſt diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>So in time when the heart is made more willing and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the requirings under the firſt diſpenſation, then by the obedience there-under man hath peace, as is before ſaid, from whence he concludeth, that God is well pleaſed with him; and ſo from theſe two grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> The terror or anger of God (out of which ariſeth the fear of Hell) and out of the life and peace of conſcience, (out of which ariſeth the hope of Heaven) man worketh all his works, and ſo is under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the firſt Covenant of works, in which the Deity ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in one Name, though we in our days know not the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereof; for when any ſoul is but under the firſt Covenant of works, he can talk of the Deity as it is divided in its proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but that is becauſe of the living in this preſent diſpenſation under the Goſpel, wherein we have received a Hiſtorical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt; by which men have got the relative knowledge of the threefold name of the Deity, and yet know not the power, and proper working of the Deity in the threefold names; but blindly looking upon them as they were put out in the outward Types, and ſo make a humble jumble of them according to the hiſtory or relation of the ſame; and from hence it is, that men talk and Preach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and yet live not in the power of what they preach or ſpeak; for they have not known the operation, and proper work (in their ſouls) of the Deity in the threefold names, or three diſtinct properties of the Deity, in the orderly manifeſtation of it ſelf in the conditions ſuitable for the ſame.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who lived in the time of the firſt diſpenſation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of works, where they had the Law of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and the Ceremonial Law alſo, and the Ordinances therein contained, they were not in the diſpenſations of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118484:61"/>Deity in its diſtinct properties, as we be, but the diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties was all included in the whole eſſence of the Deity, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt, was both one in the Father, and the Father in them, and all but one God; and though the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was thus whole in it ſelf, yet God let out himſelf in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct properties into the ſouls of the upright people under the firſt diſpenſation, and by the very ſame way they were ſaved as we be, and did enjoy God in the ſame way that we do, though not in the ſame diſpenſation; for though they lived under the Covenant of works, and Ceremonial obſervations, yet thoſe ſouls whom God had let out himſelf to in his diſtinct proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mercy, and loving kindneſs, and wiſdom, by which they knew God, and felt God, as he was in thoſe properties, though they did obſerve theſe things in that time, yet they knew that ſalvation was not in theſe things, but in the obſerving of them their hearts was led and drawn out of (and beyond) the things they obſerved, and was fixed faſt in the enjoyment of the thing ſignified in, and by theſe things, as we may ſee by <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and all the other Prophets, and all other people in theſe days; but thoſe who became blinded of that which was the myſtery of theſe things, by reaſon of the devil, ſin, and ſelfneſs, they became to live in the things they obſerved, and knew nothing of God in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and out-letting of himſelf in his diſtinct properties; and from hence it came to paſs, that their hearts was carried out to the Creature, and yet thought to pleaſe God in, and by theſe outward obſervations; and from hence it was, that when the heart was turned from God in cloſing with him in his diſtinct properties, (ſignified in the myſtery) that the obſervations of theſe things became abominable in his ſight, as you ſee in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo it is with us alſo, when it cometh to paſs, we being called into the firſt diſpenſation of works and duties, as we call them, wherein we think to pleaſe God by walking in our Goſpel obſervations, and yet our hearts carried out to the love, care and fear, ſeeking and deſiring of the Creature, then it is that our Goſpel-Forms, and holy Duties, becometh loathſome and abominable in the eyes of God, and we are in his ſight no more but as the religious Scribes and Phariſees in their firſt diſpenſation under the obſervations of the Law. But when the Lord intendeth to bring the ſouls of his people more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118484:61"/>near to himſelf, and that he may manifeſt himſelf more clearly to them in his diſtinct property, <hi>viz.</hi> In his Son Jeſus, or in making the Name of his Son to be known, and the power of his Son to appear, then doth he change the former diſpenſation, and maketh it void, and bringeth in the ſecond diſpenſation, ſuitable for ſuch a manifeſtation. And ſo it was, that when the fulneſs of time was come, Chriſt did appear in the fleſh, and in that out-letting of God in his diſtinct property, <hi>viz.</hi> His Son, it was in another manner, then he firſt manifeſted himſelf, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his name known in the beginning of the firſt diſpenſation, as is ſhewed before: For this ſecond out-letting of himſelf, was in a more milde and peaceable way, whereby and wherein he was well pleaſed in the reconciling of the World to himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. And thoſe ſouls the which he would call more near to himſelf out of the former diſpenſation, he ſo provided, that they ſhould be fitted, and prepared to meet him in the ſecond diſpenſation. And in thoſe days came <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who was to be the fore-runner before Chriſt, who ſhould prepare the way for him, and ſhould make ready a people prepared to meet their God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. And ſo it was, that by him was inſtituted the ſecond Baptiſm, and his Baptiſm was called <hi>The Baptiſm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> and his Preaching was to make the people wait for a further manifeſtation of God, then ever they had known for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and his Office was to lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he was the voice of the cryer in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 40.3. And he was the Meſſenger ſent before the face of God, in his appearing in his diſtinct property of the Son, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. And all the Preaching and work of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was to make a fit way for the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond diſpenſation, wherein he appeared in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>And ſo it was, that all that came to be baptiſed of him, was to be repenting perſons, even ſuch as the Father had wrought into ſome meaſure of want, and falling ſhort, in what they thought to have found in the firſt diſpenſation under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and thoſe that came to his Baptiſm in the ſtrength of their own conceited righteouſneſs, and building up themſelves in the opinion of their old priviledges, theſe he would not baptiſe, but gave them a repulſe according to their deſert, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. But ſo many as believed his preaching or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Kingdom of God, was brought out of the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118484:62"/>of any thing that they had formerly obſerved, and was made to know that life, and peace, and ſalvation, was to be had in none of theſe things; but in the ſecond diſtinct proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> The Son of God, or the Lamb of God, who ſhould take away the ſins of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. And as many as he baptized, was to depart from, or dye to all things whatſoever they had cloſed with (or lived in) formerly, and was to repent and mourn for their former fooliſhneſs, in thinking to have pleaſed God by their duties and ſacrifices; and when the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of theſe things was made manifeſt to them by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Iohn,</hi> then were they made willing to forſake them, and to cloſe with, and deſire to live to, and in, the life of the Son of God, whom he had held out to them; and that they did believe the truth of what he preached, they gave teſtimony thereof by undergoing his baptiſm, in which they were to look for performance of the ſecond Covenant; and this bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, the which they under-went in the outward act, ſignified to them, ſuffering or plunging, and the great afflictions to come upon them, both outwardly in the owning and profeſſing Chriſt to be the Saviour; and inwardly in the daily denying of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in keeping their hearts from depending upon any thing acted, and likewiſe in running out into the deſire, fear, care, love, or ſeeking of things created, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe was the fruits to be brought out in thoſe (who was under the office and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>John</hi>) whom he had brought into a conformity of waiting for the powerful manifeſtation of the Name, into which he had baptized them.</p>
               <p>The very ſame work in the Myſtery becometh to be fulfilled in us, in this preſent diſpenſation; for when the fulneſs of time is come that God intendeth to come nearer to the ſouls of thoſe whom he meaneth to draw to himſelf, and to make the Name of his Son to be known in the powerful manifeſtation thereof; then doth he ſend out <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to prepare the way for his appearing in their ſpirits, <hi>viz.</hi> he bringeth the Law home to the heart in the inward part thereof, by which the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart becometh manifeſted, both in the things acted, and things created, and truly knoweth how he hath deceived himſelf in the performing of his holy duties under a Goſpel conſideration: And from hence he ſhall finde, that all theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties performed in great zeal, for the honor and glory of God,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118484:62"/>as he conceived, was all wrong grounded; and likewiſe he ſhall ſee his ſecret and falſe concluſions drawn from them, and how he found life and peace in them, and thought that God would own him in, and for theſe actings, and conceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the onely man in the favor of God, and could make uſe of all the promiſes as they were ſuitable; and did confirm him in his preſent condition; likewiſe he ſhall be made to know how ſecretly he limitted God to thoſe his Goſpel Forms, and how he ſecretly hated and envied all other who had Chriſt truly manifeſted in their ſouls, and how he could have perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, if occaſion had ſerved, becauſe ſuch went about to overthrow this foundation.</p>
               <p>And then ſhall he ſee how his heart is in love with created things, and how farre ſhort his ſoule is from the true partaking of the love of God, though he conceited he had knowne the ſame formerly, and then ſhall he ſee the great vaile ſpread over his heart, which keepeth the heart from God, and God from the heart; and then ſhall he ſee ſin out of meaſure ſinful, and ſhall have cauſe to ſay, <hi>O Wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 7. And ſo it is that the ſoule becometh to enter into the operation of the ſecond Baptiſme, whereunder it ſuffereth much woe and want, in reſpect of the body of ſin it feeleth alive in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour parts of the ſoule; and likewiſe knowing how the Son of God, <hi>viz:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as yet hath never been truly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the more noble parts thereof, and ſo as yet the ſoule is but in the Wilderneſſe, in which the voyce of the Cryer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually crying and calling, <hi>Prepare, prepare the way of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and the ſoule in obedience to that cry doth turne it ſelfe wholly to ſeek the love of God, to be made knowne to it, in the ſecond diſtinct property, <hi>viz.</hi> the powerfull, and lovely, and peaceable appearing of Jeſus the Son of God, and to make his name knowne in the powerfull and mercifull delivering of the ſoule from under that preſent evill of it ſelfe, by which it is ſo carried captive oft times into the priſons of Hell and Death.</p>
               <p>And when the ſoul is thus brought to underſtand the Baptiſm of <hi>Iohn,</hi> then it is that faith beginneth to be purely operative, and not before, for now faith hath its ground-work laid in the heart, and before it was but in the head, and from what part it hath its ground, ſo doth it worke; and this faith grounded in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118484:63"/>the heart, doth carry out the ſoule into ſeeking of the vertue of the Blood of Chriſt in the Divine nature, and ſo is made willing thereby to wait for the out-pouring, or ſhedding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of the ſame, to cleanſe and waſh away that ſin, and Self, that doth ſo defile it; and likewiſe this faith doth ſo clearly carry out the ſoule from the deſire of things created, that it ſtandeth in oppoſition againſt them, when they peirce or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves into the ſoule; likewiſe by the power of this faith man is made to ſee the emptineſſe of all formes and duties, the which it hath ſo much doted on before; and likewiſe it maketh the ſoule truly know wherein its true life conſiſteth, and nothing is deſired in compariſon of that which is the true life thereof, from whence it cometh to paſſe that this ſoul ſtands at variance with every thing, which keepeth it back from the enjoyment of its life: And in this manner the Ax is laid to the root of the tree, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſharp cutting part, or the Law in its inward and ſpiritual requirings, whereby the bole of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh cut down, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtrength of deſire, love, care, or fear of, or to any thing below the love and life of the Son of God, becometh cut down, and caſt into the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> into the anger of God, by which they become burned and conſumed: But yet it cannot be truly ſaid, that anger is in God, whereby he can be made to change or to ſuffer; for anger and love is both the ſame in the eſſence of God, and that which is love in God, the ſame is anger in us; and it is the love of God that maketh us feel his anger, by reaſon of the ſin, that the love meeteth with in us; and ſo by reaſon of that love of God in us, and that ſin it meeteth with in us, the ſuffering is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced which we feel, and that ſuffering is called <hi>the anger of God:</hi> And thus we are rightly to judge of the anger of God.</p>
               <p>But now the ſoul being brought into this ſuffering way, or plunging condition, under the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> or ſpiritual cutting of the Law, wherein the abomination that maketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate beginneth to appear, then groweth ſuch a ſoul to ſink down into great humility, and in patience waiteth for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Son of God, who muſt in the manifeſting of his Name, reſtore peace, and give comfort, and deliver the ſoul out of that great deſolation made in it, by reaſon of the great abomination: And ſo it is, that when the ſoul is rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118484:63"/>by the ſecond baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> then in his own time and place, the name of the Son becometh manifeſted in that ſoul; and the Lord whom it hath ſought doth come into his temple, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2. And then it is that the vertue of the name of the Son of God becometh powerful in delivering the ſoul out of that deſolate wilderneſs, from amongſt the enemies that it found there, and thoſe luſts that led it captive is become captived, and the ſhadow of death is diſſipated, and the garment of mourning is caſt off, and the ſoul cloathed in the garment of praiſe; and then the ſoul can rejoyce, and rightly ſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to him that hath done theſe things for it.</p>
               <p>And thus it is, that God in the ſecond appearance in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct property, becometh to be known in a more ſweet, and loving, and peaceable manner, then he was known in the firſt Name, before the Godhead had divided it ſelf, as is before ſaid. And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> in the firſt diſpenſation under the Covenant of works, by his baptiſm reached out the ſoul to <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in the ſecond diſpenſation led out the ſoul to Chriſt; and ſo the ſoul can truly witneſs the Name of the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>I would have enlarged more upon the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> but that I have already ſpoken ſomething thereof in a little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, called <hi>The Anti-god, with his threefold attributes, diſcovered in the out-ſide religious man;</hi> and in that you may ſee ſomething which is needful to be known, the which I have omitted here.</p>
               <p>But now I proceed and ſpeak a word of the third Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> The Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt; and this is that which is more excellent then the other two former, becauſe of its time, operation, and effect; of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. And this baptiſm was witneſſed by <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> himſelf, when he gave teſtimony of Chriſt, who was to be the Miniſter of this Baptiſm, and told the people, that he that was to come after him, <hi>&amp;c. ſhould baptize them with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire, whoſe fan is in his hand, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 3. And what <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did witneſs herein, the ſame had he received of the Father, who ſent him both to baptiſe and bear witneſs of Chriſt, that he was the Son of God, and what his coming was for, and what his office ſhould be, <hi>John</hi> 1.33. Now when Jeſus Chriſt was in the fleſh, he baptiſed none; for this his baptiſm was to be in its time and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118484:64"/>place ſuitable for its operation; and that was to be after his Aſcenſion; though he had promiſed the ſame before his death, yet that promiſe was not to be fulfilled till after his death, and at the firſt adminiſtration thereof the Holy Ghoſt fell upon the perſons baptized in a viſible form of cloven tongues of fire, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>By which viſible appearance, was held out the nature of the operation of that Ghoſtly Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> A twofold ſpeech or ſpeaking, riſing out of a twofold ground, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſenſible feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of love, joy, and life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And likewiſe the ſenſible feeling of ſorrow, ſuffering, and death: And from theſe two grounds was to ariſe all their ſpeaking, who was baptized with the Holy Ghoſt; and this was the pure language that God had promiſed to return to the people, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. And thoſe who had this pure language returned to them in this Ghoſtly Baptiſm, was able to ſpeak of the wondrous works of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.11:</p>
               <p>Now this third diſtinct property of God, <hi>viz.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt, or the third out-letting of the Godhead in the third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct property, is the moſt cleareſt way of manifeſtation that man attaineth to in the fleſh; for this is that which giveth man the true knowledge of the myſtery of God, and the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſin and ſelfneſs; and the operation of this diſtinct proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty worketh the ſpirit of man out of the myſtery of Self, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the myſtery of God; and this work it worketh, by bringing man into the fellowſhip of the ſuffering with Chriſt, whereby the body of that ſin and ſelf becometh to be crucified; and likewiſe it comforteth man, and maketh him able to bear the Croſs with Chriſt, until the death of ſin and ſelf be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; and ſo the ſpirit be made partaker of the life and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and with him become aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all powers and principalities, and ſo to reign with him.</p>
               <p>And therefore it was neceſſary, that Chriſt ſhould both ſuffer, and riſe again, and aſcend, before he gave out the Holy Ghoſt; becauſe as he ſuffered, ſo he left the ſame example of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be undergone by thoſe who ſhould be his followers: And while he was with them in the fleſh, they could not ſuffer as they ſhould do afterward; for then he was the Bridegroom, and they were the children of the Bride-chamber, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.34. And ſo long as he was with them in the fleſh, they could not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118484:64"/>grow up to be perfect men, nor to the ſtature and fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. For while Chriſt was in the fleſh, his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers looked too much at his bodily preſence; and therefore it was meet that his bodily preſence ſhould be taken away, that ſo his ghoſtly preſence might be manifeſted to them; and therefore he told them, except he went away from them, the Comforter would not come, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. But his Diſciples being but as yet the children of the Bride-chamber, was but yong in the holy underſtanding, neither being acquainted with great joy or great ſuffering, becauſe as yet they were not in a condition ſo ſutable for either, as they ſhould be thereafter; but this they could not believe, but ſorrow filled their hearts when Chriſt told them of going away from them, <hi>John</hi> 16.6.</p>
               <p>But herein is the great wiſdom of God made known in the orderly and ſucceſſive out-lettings of himſelf to the ſons of men, ſtooping to his capacity in every condition, that ſo by little and little, man may be wrought and drawn up into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to live and abide in that center from whence he had his Being. And therefore as he had made his Name known in the firſt dark diſpenſation, by appearing in our fleſh; but moſt clear of all by taking the two former away, that the third might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, wherein we might ſee him, and live in him in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, and worſhip him as he is a Spirit, the which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, while we are ſo much in our ſelves, both in reaſon and ſence, while we are under the firſt and ſecond diſpenſation; and therefore it was that Chriſts bodily preſence in the ſecond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was to be taken away, that made his followers look too much upon him, as he was in that appearance, whereby their Reaſon and Sence got too much life; and therefore that both Reaſon and Sence might loſe their lives, his firſt bodily preſence muſt be out of the way, that his ghoſtly preſence might appear in the Divine Nature; in which, and by which, he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the baptiſer of Souls with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire, by which baptiſm he would burn up and conſume all the old rubbiſh and reliques of ſin and ſelf, both in Sence and Reaſon, and bring the Spirit out of, and from the captivity of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And while Chriſt was in the fleſh, he ſhewed them an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life, which he would have thoſe that would be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to follow, and likewiſe he told them how great things his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118484:65"/>followers was to ſuffer, under the Ghoſtly Baptiſm; and ſo he left them the example of his own ſuffering, and death alſo; the which they ſhould have as a rule to walk by, until the body of ſin ſhould be crucified and deſtroyed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. And ſo it was, that after Chriſt in the Divine Nature began to adminiſter the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, the perſon who was baptiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, by the vertue thereof became ſo carried out after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample both of the life and death of Chriſt, that they thought nothing too dear to forſake, ſo that they might but attain to the fellowſhip of Chriſt, both in his life, death, and reſurrection. And this was the whole delight of theſe ſouls who had been baptiſed of Chriſt, by the (proceeding or) coming of the Holy Ghoſt out of the Divine Nature into their ſouls, by which they were led out of all things, acted, or created, or enjoyed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſelf had gotten life, or might get life. And this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, when he ſaid, <hi>he counted all things but droſs and dung, in compariſon of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> And that he might be loſt in all things and found in Chriſt, by way of conformity to his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and death, that thereby he might attain to the reſurrection of the dead, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo it is to this preſent day, that thoſe ſouls whom God draweth into a near union of himſelf, he draweth them out of the firſt and ſecond out-letting of himſelf in the firſt and ſecond diſpenſation, and ſo bringeth them into the third diſpenſation, or Ghoſtly Baptiſm; in which, the body of ſin and ſelfneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh found out and forſaken; for whileſt the firſt and ſecond diſpenſation is in force, the body of ſin is not ſo clearly found out, nor can be ſo forſaken as it ought.</p>
               <p>But who is it that will believe the truth hereof? for the ſons of men is blinded of the right ſight and knowledge of the truth, and by reaſon of the love they have to luſt, ſin, and ſelfneſs, they are become enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt; and if any have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the firſt diſpenſation beforeſaid, they think themſelves to have attained all that is neceſſary, and that they need no more, and ſo becometh to ſettle upon the lees of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and ſo becometh the reſiſters of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. And if any be brought out of the firſt Baptiſm under the firſt diſpenſation, which containeth in it the Covenant of works, and ſo be made partakers of the ſecond Baptiſm, by which they are brought into, and prepared to meet Chriſt in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118484:65"/>his firſt appearance; and when they have known the Son of God (or God in his diſtinct property of the Son) manifeſting himſelf to their ſoul, by which the ſoul hath comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and refreſhment, and deliverance from its former troubles; and now it finding the effects of the propitiation of the Son, in covering and hiding its ſin, and in juſtifying the ſoul, and taking of the power of condemnation from it, then doth that ſoul conclude, That all is done, and can be pleaſed with that preſent condition, ſuppoſing they have that which never will fail, and ſay in their heart, They ſhall not be removed, becauſe the Lord of his goodneſs hath made their mountain ſo ſtrong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. And from theſe falſe concluſions, many a ſoul becometh to loſe it ſelf, and turn back again into the world, and into the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Creature, from which it was delivered; and ſo man fooliſhly concluding, That being in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he ſhall ſee the bondage of <hi>Egypt</hi> no more; but while man is but in the enjoyment of the firſt manifeſtation of God, in the firſt appearance of his Son, he is but a babe, and but ignorant of what the minde of God is in that preſent condition; and therefore they are very ſubject to be content with that preſent ſtation, becauſe it pleaſeth them ſo well, ſuppoſing that there is none that have attained any further, then what they have already attained too, when as alas they know not as yet, what it is to die with Chriſt on the Croſs, nor what the fellowſhip of his ſufferings is, nor what the vertual power of his reſurrection meaneth. And ſo it is, that from the idolizing of that preſent enjoyment, they in a very ſhort time become to be caſt out of that enjoyment; and yet do they not know that they are ſo caſt out, becauſe of the falſe fiend who hath got again into the houſe from whence he was gone out, and counterfeiteth God through the help of the imagination; and ſo maketh theſe ſouls believe, That God is their preſent portion, and that they have ſuch a faſt hank of him, that nothing can be able to ſeparate them, when at that very inſtant of time the heart is in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity with the Creature.</p>
               <p>I fear that this is the very condition of many now adays, who having known God after this manner beforeſaid, and yet have forſaken him again, and turned to the Creature; and yet do but little know that they be ſo far carried away from God, as they are.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:118484:66"/>
               <p>But when God in his orderly proceeding goeth on in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoule through all the dangers and difficulties of the creature and Selfe, then doth he not ſuffer the ſoule to have what it would have, nor injoy what it would injoy in that firſt manifeſtation of himſelf in the name of his Son; but as the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſence of Jeſus was to be taken away in his appearing in the ſecond diſpenſation in the fleſh, (that ſo he might come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the Spirit, or ghoſtly Baptiſme, by which they ſhould ſtill be led on till they were in the neareſt and ſafeſt union of the Father and the Son that could be attained to in the body) ſo it is, that the ghoſtly preſence in the firſt manifeſtation in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt be taken away, that ſo the ſpirit may come to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more ſure partaking of the Divine nature then it could in the firſt manifeſtation. For as Chriſts followers could have been pleaſed to have ſtill injoyed the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the firſt appearing in the fleſh; ſo would a ſoul be pleaſed with the firſt manifeſtation of Gods appearing in the name of his Son to the ſpirit. But as Chriſts bodily preſence muſt be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that thereby the life of Selfe which lived in the ſence and reaſon (of his Diſciples under that preſent injoyment) might become deſtroyed, and over-throwne, by the coming againe in the power of the Spirit, or ghoſtly Baptiſm: So it is that the firſt appearance of God in Chriſt, in the firſt appearance of the ſoule muſt be hidden, and taken away, becauſe of ſo much life of ſelfe in the ſence and reaſon, and that by a further and more cleare and ſafe way to manifeſt himſelfe in the ſoule, and that is by the pouring out of the Holy Ghoſt into it, by the vertue of which the ſoule becometh Baptiſed into the ſuffering and death of Chriſt, whereby the life of ſence and reaſon becometh to dye, and the ſpirit brought out of the clawes of Sinne, Death, Devill, and Hell, and the power of the Reſurrection of Chriſt becometh to be known, and the body of Sin becometh to bee deſtroyed, by the powerfull working and burning of this ghoſtly Baptiſme, and this was the very Baptiſme the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of, when he ſaid, <hi>Know you not ſo many of us as were Baptiſed into Chriſt were Baptiſed into his death, therefore we are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him, by Baptiſme into his death, &amp;c. For if we have been planted together into the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall alſo be in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his reſurrection, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin may be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118484:66"/>ſerve ſin, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 6.2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. And thoſe ſoules who know God in this worke can witneſſe to the truth of the three-fold name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they know the power and working of God in theſe three Baptiſmes, under theſe three names, and none elſe can ſpeak rightly of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have but the knowledg thereof by relation; &amp; though God let out himſelfe in this three-fold manner, as is before ſaid, yet God is but one and the ſame God; and though there bee theſe three Baptiſmes, yet they all make up but one perfect Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, by which the ſoule is perfectly compleated in one faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. whereby the ſoule becometh led out of all things acted or created, and all ſufferings, or injoyments in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, below the injoyment of the fellowſhip of Chriſt in his Suffering, Death, and Reſurrection, and this is the very end and effect of all former out-lettings of God in any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid diſpenſations; and for this very end it was that Chriſt gave out his command to teach, and diſcipline all Nations, and Baptize them in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Friends, I have but given you a dark glimps of theſe things, for the clearer illuſtrating of them requireth more time then I have allotted to me at preſent, and would containe a greater volume then at preſent I meane to put out; but this which here I have intimated may give you ſome ſight in the whole: and I wiſh that every one of you were ſo wiſe as to finde out in your owne heart the whole myſterie hereof; and this I have holden out to you, that thereby you may partly ſee what is contained in the type of Baptiſme, and that it is not the forme or type that bringeth any happineſſe to the ſoule. But in caſe you ſay, you live not in the outward forme of Baptiſme, but in the power of the Myſterie; from whence is it that ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fruits thereof appear amongſt you, who are of the order of the Brotherhood in outward form of re-baptizing? for though you may think you obey the command of Chriſt in this your act, yet being ignorant of the minde of Chriſt in this command, you doe obey him no more then <hi>Saul</hi> did the command of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.14. for I can as juſtly ſay to you as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, What meaneth the bleating of the ſheep, and the lowing of theſe oxen in mine eares?</hi> For though ſome amongſt you in your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hood can ſpeake of ſome experiences, and ſay ſomething
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118484:67"/>what God hath done for their ſoules, yet I ſee the world in the heart of ſuch, yea and the love of praiſe and honour, and the livelineſſe of affection to created things; looke to your owne hearts, and you ſhall finde what I ſay is true, and if it be ſo, take it for granted, you know not the minde of Chriſt in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Baptiſm: but you content your ſelves with the forme, and if you knew but the myſterie, the forme would not be of ſo great value with you; but as all other formes are but empty things, ſo is your forme alſo, and they ſhall all periſh in time, and all ſoules ſhall be deceived who live in them. For nothing ſhall ſtand but what is the ſubſtance and myſterie of all forms; and what ſoule is not brought out of formes into that which is the myſterie, ſhall periſh as doth the formes, for in all diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and all ordinances in diſpenſations formerly there hath been a change, and the reaſon why former things inſtituted was changed, was becauſe of ſin amongſt men, who made Idols of thoſe ordinances: for the minde and intent of God in all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances was to draw the heart of men to himſelfe out of the creature; and ſo when God owned theſe his ordinances, and anſwered men in them, then was the hearts of men in too great love with theſe ordinances; and when the heart beginneth to cleave to any ordinance, then the heart getteth liberty to run out into the creature, and yet man can bleſſe himſelfe, and quiet his blinde Conſcience with obſerving the ordinances, and ſo the ordinances becometh Idolized, and ſo abominable in the eyes of God; and ſo it is that theſe things God ordained to bring man to himſelfe, by reaſon of the body of ſinne in man they have drawne man further from his God, and there is not any formaliſt in <hi>England</hi> of what forme ſoever, that contendeth for his forme, can excuſe himſelfe in what is here expreſſed. But here I leave you in your forms, and wiſh that God may ſo owne you in your formes, that you may ſee a cleare way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of your formes, and to come to cloſe with that which is the ſubſtance; and then you will not fall out with any who are not of the ſame forme with you; neither will you ſo much contend for your formes, for then you ſhall ſee how all formes are but empty things, and not worth ſo much diſpute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; which hath been the occaſion of the ſpilling of ſo much bloud as hath been ſpilt; but let me tell you one thing, that no hand ſhall be guiltleſſe of bloud who hath ſhed any mans bloud
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118484:67"/>for maintaining the uprightneſſe of his forme: for it will bee found, that that hand that hath ſhed the bloud of any man for oppoſing his form, he ſlew but his brother that he might ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his bloud to an Idol; and this one day will lye heavie upon the heart of thoſe that have done it. But what is this I have ſaid? who will beleeve it? for every one in his forme can bleſs himſelfe in what he hath done, and quiet his blinde Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by kiſſing of his Idol; but the time is in coming, and ſhall ſhortly be, that all Idols ſhall ceaſe, and all formall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall be deſtroyed, for we who are alive are in the laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and under the laſt types that ever ſhall be upon the earth: and when theſe types under which we live ſhall come to be worſhipped to the height, then changed ſhall they be, and I leave it to you to gueſſe what thing ſhal then be eſtabliſhed; the time ſhall ſhortly be, even ſo come Lord Jeſus, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>A word to the Free-Gracians.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riends, you who pretend the Free-grace of God, without the Creatures actings, I need not write to you of your idolizing of Forms, for I know you are not tied to any Form: But my Friends, I ask you the queſtion, How came you to part with your Forms? was it the Free-grace of God indeed that called you out of Forms, or was it your ſubtil-ſelf that caſt you out of Forms? I much fear the devil hath played the cheater with you, and you have not ſeen wherein he hath deceived you; and ſo you are bereaved both of the Form and Power. I know you much pretend all to be of God, and that he giveth his grace freely without the act, or deſert of the Creature. I know there is a truth in what you ſay, but yet did ever any of you receive grace: But firſt you were active Creatures, and ſought grace more then ever you ſought any earthly thing? If you ſay you have grace, and yet ſought not grace, it is no leſs then a marvel to me: But in caſe you ſay, that you ſought grace before you received grace, why do you ſo much cry down the Creatures actings? do you think to bring any a nearer way to grace, then your ſelves have gone? if you do, you peradventure ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and while you by that way go about to draw men to grace, it is ſix to one you keep them from grace. I know your preaching and ſpeaking of that ſubject, will beget you many a one to be of the ſame minde with you; for your doctrine ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well to the fleſhly part of man, and ſoon is it believed, and as ſoon practiſed; for I know not what will hinder the ſucceſs of it, for I know the devil will not oppoſe it, neither will the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118484:68"/>fleſh oppoſe it; and I am ſure the world is a friend to it, and then it is poſſible there is nothing that is evil that will oppoſe it. And no marvel though the multitude dance ſo madly after your pipe, I know you ſee no greater evil, then that which is the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing of Forms; but that is becauſe you know not the evil of your own hearts, and how the great myſtery of evil lyeth there; and becauſe you know it not, you are carried out to ſee the evil of others, who is not of the ſame faith with you; and ſome of you, yea, thoſe who be of your cheif Teachers, are ſo exceedingly carried out by the power of Free-grace (as they pretend) that they go about to do marvels, <hi>viz.</hi> to pluck up where never any thing hath been planted, and to take away acting from theſe people who never troubled themſelves with acting any thing for God, or for any kinde of formal worſhip to God.</p>
               <p>But if ſuch were but half wiſe, they might ſpare their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſuch people have a teacher within them, that will teach them to forſake acting any thing for God, or the worſhip of God: And therefore they need not any of your outward teaching to help them. But do you not think you do a great peece of Gods ſervice herein? be judge your ſelves. I would know of you, whether acting or believing be the firſt brought out in any man; if you ſay Faith, I would know what Faith it is; for the juſtifying Faith it cannot be, for that is manifeſt after works, and never doth any man know it truly, until he have acted, and found the emptineſs of his actings; and theſe things which he thought ſhould have brought out life, bringeth out death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. And yet when this faith is brought out, yet doth not that Faith make acting voide, <hi>For faith without works is dead, Jam.</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>But if you ſay a man may have juſtifying faith without works, that I deny; for where-ever faith is that juſtifieth, the ſame cannot be without works. I know man may have an hiſtorical faith without works, but the juſtifying faith no man can have without works; but it is one thing to have works, and it is another thing to be juſtified by works; and here is the Myſtery; finde it out if you can; but for the want of the right knowledge of the Myſtery, you become to make a diviſion, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118484:69"/>jarring between faith and works, which in themſelves do not differ, but agreeth in a ſweet harmony in thoſe ſouls, who have found out the myſtery in them both: And never ſhall you bring any ſoul to be a true believer, before you have brought him into an active way before; except you can command God to work miracles in his immediate way.</p>
               <p>But my Friends, I know full well where you erre, and what is the ground of your opinion, even you who are the pureſt in this your Free-grace tenet; For even you who have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the grace of God, I know you knew it was the goodneſſe of God that freed your ſouls from what they were captived with, and that all your actings could not do it, till God himſelf beſtowed his Free-grace upon you.</p>
               <p>This I confeſſe is truth, but did every any of you finde the Free-grace of God made known to you, before you had acted to your utmoſt endeavor, and was made to ſee the emptineſs of your actings. I know as many of you as have known true freedom will confeſs this; and can you tell me truly, That if you had not acted, and thereby ſeen the emptineſs of your act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whether you ſhould have known the freeneſſe of grace, yea, or nay; but becauſe that you were not freed by your act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is therefore actings of none effect? God forbid; for though the Apoſtle were not juſtified by the Law, yet did he not make voide the Law, but counted it of neceſſary uſe; for thereby cometh the knowledge of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. So actings, though they do not juſtifie, yet by them man becometh to know the emptineſs that is in them; for before any action be brought out, the goodneſſe or badneſſe of it cannot be known; and it is as natural to man to depend upon his actings, as the skin cleaveth to his fleſh; and man cannot be freed from depending thereon, until he truly ſee the evil in them; and he cannot ſee the evil in them, until they be brought out; and until he ſee the evil in them, he cannot be juſtified by Free-grace: And for this very purpoſe God hath given man power to act, and given out commands that he ſhould act, that thereby man might be brought to ſee what was in his actings, and how far he could recover out of his faln condition by his actings; that ſo where he came ſhort, he might know the goodneſs of God in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118484:69"/>and therefore while you pretend and preach Faith ſo much, you bring but the ſouls of the people into a ſnare, and they are in as great danger to periſh by your doctrine, as is the ſouls of thoſe people who are taught to merit Heaven by their actings; for you run as far in your extream, as they do in their extream.</p>
               <p>But I would have you to take notice of one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> In caſe you have been freed by grace, whether hath your ſpirit or your fleſh got better hold of the freedom; if your ſpirit have gotten the freedom, then is your fleſh in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and then be ſure it will be ſtriving for freedom; and I believe you ſhall have no great quiet, ſo long as it hath any power to move: For though your ſpirit may be freed from the condemning of your conſcience, yet I beleeve your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is not freed from the ſtrivings of the fleſh; but in caſe the fleſh have ſtoln your freedom from the ſpirit, then its poſſible all will be quiet within, and then no marvel if you cry up Free-grace ſo faſt.</p>
               <p>But let me tell you one thing, He that knoweth moſt of Free-grace, knoweth moſt of bondage with it. This may ſeem a paradox to you, but if you know not what I mean, you may take it for granted, That your fleſh hath got the greater part of your Free-grace; and then while you tell other people of freedom by grace, you your ſelves become the ſervants of ſin, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>LOok into your own hearts, and try whether this be true or not; for if you finde your hearts and affections carried out to any thing below God, and that you have any complacence, in either pleaſure, praiſe, or profit, or what elſe is below the center of Spirits, you may believe, That all is not as it ſhould be; but yet I know you will not greatly care, for it is God muſt do all, and the Creature can do nothing; and therefore you need but onely beleeve, and all will be well enough; but the time will come, that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118484:70"/>every one muſt be rewarded according to his works; and he that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall not enter into Heaven, but he that doth the will of the Father muſt enter.</p>
               <p>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with with me, and will give to every man according as his works ſhall be.</p>
